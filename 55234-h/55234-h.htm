  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>THE life of the General Marquis de La Fayette
is intimately connected with the two most
important epochs in the history of both France
and America. His name binds together these
nations by indissoluble bonds of sympathy; and
Washington and La Fayette will forever be found
side by side in the annals of history.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a large portion of the material presented in
this volume has been gathered from French works
never before translated and which are now out of
print, and also from original files of newspapers,
and various manuscripts written by members of
the La Fayette family, a more complete life of
General La Fayette is here offered than has
before appeared, either in this country or in
Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>LA FAYETTE was not only the Knight of Liberty
in two worlds and in two centuries, but was also
the champion of law and order. Other men have fought
for freedom; but few men in history have so truly and
broadly comprehended the indissoluble tie which must
ever bind liberty to law, if the shackles of oppression
be unloosed, and the equal rights of men become the
watchwords of national peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The battle of Minden, in 1758, was fought, and a young
and valiant French marquis sacrificed his life upon that
battle-field. He was the first Marquis de La Fayette.
At that time his son, Marie-Jean-Paul-Roch-Yves-Gilbert
de Motier La Fayette, lay in his cradle, an infant of
seven months old. The warlike mantle of the father
fell upon the son. But gentler spirits than <em>Stern War</em>
hovered over his pillow. <em>Gleaming-eyed Liberty</em> said,
“I will make him my champion”; and <em>mild-eyed Law</em>
bent over the cradle and smoothed the baby brow,
murmuring, “I will make him love peace and order.”
Thus War, Liberty, and Law christened the fatherless
child, and to the long list of titled names which already
weighted his infant forehead, they added yet another,
of nobler rank than all; for they placed there, in letters
of glowing light, the unrivalled title, <em>Knight of
Liberty</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The name of La Fayette was distinguished as far back
as the fourteenth century. “The founder of the family
was a Marshal de La Fayette, who defeated the English
at the battle of Baugé shortly before the time of Jeanne
d’Arc,—a success which raised the hopes of the Dauphin,
who afterwards recovered the French throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the seventeenth century two noble and illustrious
women bore the ancient name. One of these ladies was
Louise de La Fayette, maid of honor to Queen Anne of
Austria, whose son, Louis XIII., fell so deeply in love
with the young lady that he proposed to establish her
in his country house at Versailles, a royal shooting-box
built before the time of the great château. Alarmed at
the infatuation of the king, and seeing no way of resisting
the royal commands save by devoting herself to
Heaven, Louise de La Fayette retired to the Convent
of the Visitation, and at once took the vows. She died
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>at the age of fifty, as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mère Angélique</em></span>, abbess of Chaillot,
a convent she had founded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her brother, Count La Fayette, married, in 1655,
Marie Madeline Pioche de la Vergne, an intimate friend
of Madame de Sévigné, and authoress of the ‘Princesse
de Clèves,’ a classical romance of the old school, still read
by lovers of the literature of the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wife of the renowned General La Fayette, whom
he married in 1774, when he was sixteen and she a year
younger, was Marie Adrienne Françoise, second daughter
of the Duke d’Ayen, and granddaughter of Maréschal de
Noailles. After three years of happy married life, he
left her shortly before the birth of their second child, to
hasten to the aid of the American colonies. The infant
born during her father’s absence became Madame Charles
de Latour-Maubourg.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1881, in the Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> appeared the following
account of the descendants of General La Fayette: “His
only son, George Washington La Fayette, married, in
1802, Mademoiselle Desture de Thacy, and had five children.
The eldest, Oscar, died in 1881. His wife, a relative
of M. de Pusy, one of the prisoners at Olmütz, had
died after one year of married life, and he never married
again. The second son, Edmond, the present head of
the house, is now sixty-two, and a bachelor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The daughters are Madame Adolphe Périer (her husband
was a nephew of Casimir Périer), Madame Bureaux
de Pusy, and Madame Gustave de Beaumont. Mesdames
Pusy and Beaumont are still living. The former has a
son, an officer of merit, and two daughters. M. Paul de
Beaumont, son of Madame Gustave de Beaumont, was a
cabinet minister under M. Daufaure. Madame Périer
left daughters, one of whom married M. de Sahune.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame Charles de Latour-Maubourg, who was born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>whilst her father, General La Fayette, was serving in
America, had two daughters, Madame de Brigode and
Madame de Perron. General Perron, husband of the
latter lady, was a Piedmontese, and a president of the
Council of Ministers in Piedmont. He was killed at
the battle of Novara.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette’s other daughter, Madame de Lasteyrie,
was named Virginie. She was the comfort and staff of
her father’s age. She married, in 1800, the Marquis
Louis de Lasteyrie, who served with the army for some
years, but being wounded, retired to the Château of La
Grange, between Fontainbleau and Paris,—a place which
became the happy home of the entire La Fayette family.
There lived the general and the family of Charles de
Latour-Maubourg; and thither, too, after a time, came
George Washington La Fayette and his children.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Marquis de Lasteyrie, who died before General
La Fayette, left four children. Of these are Madame
Charles de Rémusat, whose husband is the son of the
distinguished lady whose ‘Memoirs’ have been recently
given to the world; and Madame de Corcelle, wife of a
former ambassador to Rome. M. Jules de Lasteyrie,
the only son, was made a senator. He married a lady
of the English branch of the House of Rohan-Chabot.
His only son holds an office at present at Abbeville.
The third and youngest daughter of the Marquis de
Lasteyrie married M. d’Assailly, and is mother of two
sons: one, councillor-general of the Deux-Sèvres; the
other, a captain of Chasseurs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The connections of the La Fayette family are distinguished
and numerous. Through the De Grammonts,
they are allied to the Count de Merode, senator from
the Department of the Doubs; to his brother, who held
high office under Pius IX.; and to Anna, Countess of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Montalembert. The family of Ségur is also related to
the La Fayette family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Beranger called La Fayette “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>L’Homme des deux
mondes</em></span>” (the man of two worlds), and he might also
have added, the man of two centuries. Europe and
America have both united to do him homage, and the
glorious independence which he aided in securing in
one century, he lived to behold in the next, realizing
greater permanency and prosperity than even his fondest
dreams had dared to hope for.</p>

<p class='c010'>The American Republic held him in grateful remembrance
as a <em>Revolutionary Hero</em>; while France venerated
his memory as the Friend and Protector of the People.
High on the lists of chivalry the name of La Fayette
glows with undying lustre; but as the defender of the
oppressed and the protector of the weak, he is the <em>People’s
Hero</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>While his remains were being carried to the tomb, surrounded
by an escort of the National Guard, a poor man,
with tattered clothing and tottering steps, endeavored to
press his way through the crowd and place himself in the
funeral procession directly behind the bier. One of the
Guard, obstructing his passage, said to him, “You see that
none but the family are admitted here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We all belong to his family,” replied the old man,
with a voice choked with emotion and eyes full of tears;
“we all belong to his family, for he loved us all as his
children.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately the ranks of the National Guard fell reverently
backward, and a way was quickly opened for the
old peasant, and he walked to the cemetery directly
behind the remains of him whose self-sacrificing devotion
had won for him this beautiful testimony of love
and honor; and in the name of humanity and brotherly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>kindness, this old man—unconsciously—laid upon the
tomb of La Fayette the most precious memorial which
could be offered to his memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Château of Chavaniac, in the province of
Auvergne, the Marquis de La Fayette was born and
passed the first seven or eight years of his life. He
was so frail a child that for some years the indications
were strong that he would enjoy only a brief career.
Being fatherless, his education was the care of his
mother, who faithfully performed her sacred duties.</p>

<p class='c010'>A faint tinge of health began gradually to glow in his
cheeks, his attenuated frame showed some signs of vigor,
and the presage of an early death became less foreboding.
While his body had been so frail, however, his mind had
made rapid progress.</p>

<p class='c010'>To a friend he said in after years: “You ask me at
what period I first experienced my ardent love for liberty
and glory. I recollect no time of life anterior to my enthusiasm
for anecdotes of glorious deeds, and to my projects
of travelling over the world to acquire fame. At eight
years of age my heart beat when I heard of a wolf
that had done some injury, and caused still more alarm
in our neighborhood, and the hope of meeting it was
the object of all my walks. When I arrived at college,
nothing ever interrupted my studies except my ardent
wish to study without restraint. I never deserved to be
chastised, but, in spite of my usual gentleness, it would
have been dangerous to attempt to do so. I recollect with
pleasure that, when I was to describe in rhetoric a perfect
courser, I sacrificed the hope of obtaining a prize, and
described the one which, on perceiving the whip, threw
his rider.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Republican anecdotes always delighted me, and when
my new connections wished to obtain for me a place at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>court, I did not hesitate displeasing them to preserve my
independence.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>CHÂTEAU OF CHAVANIAC.—LAFAYETTE’S BIRTHPLACE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At the age of twelve years La Fayette was entered at
the college of Louis le Grand, in Paris, where he zealously
pursued his studies. In Latin and Greek classics he became
especially proficient. Owing to his high rank his
literary pursuits were subject to frequent interruptions,
for he early gained the attention of royalty, and the gay
French court was very alluring to a youth passionately
fond of brilliant society. However, his love for study
and his enthusiasm for the military calling prevented his
becoming a courtier. By the death of his mother in 1770,
and of his grandfather a short time after, he became
possessed of great wealth, which, being entirely at his
own control, surrounded him with a crowd of fawning
flatterers. At the age of fifteen he became a page to
Queen Marie Antoinette, and was enrolled a member of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mousquetaires du Roi</em></span>, the body-guard of the king,
which was composed solely of the descendants of the
most highly titled families in France. Through the
influence of the queen, he was promoted to the rank of
a commissioned officer in this corps. Speaking of which,
he said “that his military services only interrupted his
studies on review days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the age of sixteen La Fayette was married to the
Comtesse de Noailles, daughter of the Duke d’Ayen.
Madame de La Fayette herself gives the following account
of her somewhat strange wooing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was scarcely twelve years old, when M. de La Fayette
was proposed to my mother for one of us. He himself
was only fourteen. His extreme youth, no parents
to guide him,—having lost all his near relatives, and having
no one in whom he could repose confidence,—a large
fortune already in his possession, which my mother looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>upon as a dangerous gift—all these considerations made
her at first refuse him, notwithstanding the good opinion
she had acquired of his personal qualities. She persisted
several months in her refusal; but my father was not discouraged,
and as one of his friends observed to him that
my mother had gone too far ever to change her mind, he
did justice to her straightforwardness in the midst of his
anger against her. ‘You do not know Madame d’Ayen,’
he said; ‘however far she may have gone, you will see
that she will give way like a child if you prove to her
that she is in the wrong; but, on the other hand, she will
never yield if she does not see her mistake.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Accordingly, when she was told that her daughter
would not leave her during the first years of her marriage,
and that it would only be celebrated at the end of
two years, after M. de La Fayette had finished his education,
she accepted him whom she cherished ever after
as the most tenderly beloved son, whom she valued from
the first moment that she became acquainted with him,
and who alone could have sustained the strength of my
heart after having lost her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was some time after my mother’s consent that I
was spoken to of M. de La Fayette, towards whom I was
already attracted by feeble forerunners of that deep and
tender affection which every day has united us more and
more in the midst of all the vicissitudes of this life, in
the midst of the blessings and misfortunes which have
filled it for the last twenty-four years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With what pleasures I learned that, for more than a
year, my mother had looked upon him and loved him as
a son! She told me all the good she had heard with
regard to him, all she thought of him herself, and I saw
that he already felt for her that filial affection which
was to be the blessing of my life. She tried to calm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>my poor weak brain, which was over-excited by the importance
of the coming event. She taught me to pray—she
prayed herself—for the blessings of Heaven on my
future happiness. As I had the happiness of remaining
with her, my only feelings were those of deep emotion.
I was then fourteen and a half.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s wife brought to him a fortune, which, together
with his own inheritance, gave him a yearly revenue
of $37,500.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young marquis is thus described at this time:
“He was then a handsome young man, of commanding
figure and pleasing features, notwithstanding his deep
red hair. His forehead, though receding, was fine; his
eyes clear hazel, and his mouth and chin delicately
formed, exhibiting beauty rather than strength. The
expression of his countenance was strongly indicative of
a generous and gallant spirit, with an air of conscious
greatness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His manners were frank and amiable, his movements
light and graceful. Formed, both by nature and education,
to be the ornament of a court, and already distinguished
by his varied and attractive qualities in the
circle of his noble acquaintance, his free principles
were neither withered by the sunshine of royalty, nor
weakened by flattery and temptation. He dressed in a
costume then worn by a gentleman who affected not the
extreme of fashion, nor the reverse. His bearing was
elegant, full of vivacity, and his conversational powers
were of a high order, and their activity varied much
with his moods, sometimes mild and winning, and again
ardent and enthusiastic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the summer of 1776 La Fayette, as an officer of the
French army, was stationed on military duty in the citadel
of Metz. At this time he was little over eighteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>years of age. Through the Duke of Gloucester, a
brother of the king of England, La Fayette first learned
of the struggles in America. The Duke of Gloucester
had been exiled from the court of Great Britain on account
of his impolitic marriage, and was then at Metz.
The duke was constantly receiving reports of the American
struggle for independence, and he openly described
the plans of the British ministry to crush this uprising
of the colonists. La Fayette’s fiery ardor in the cause
of liberty was quickened at the news of the oppressed
Americans, fighting with such vast odds against them,
bravely defying the most powerful nation on the globe.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette immediately resigned his position at Metz,
and hastened to Paris, determined to devote his life and
fortune to the aid of the courageous band of patriots
who had just declared their independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Knowing the opposition he would meet from family,
friends, and the government, he made his preparations
with the greatest secrecy, not even revealing his intentions
to his wife, to whom he was most devoted. His
heaven-born principles of liberty could no longer be kept
in check by inaction, and he was ready to sacrifice every
personal interest in life to the cause of oppressed humanity.</p>

<p class='c010'>After having partially completed his arrangements, La
Fayette disclosed his scheme to his relative the Count
de Broglie. The count was bitterly opposed to the undertaking,
and pictured to La Fayette all the difficulties
and dangers of the enterprise. “Your uncle perished in
the wars in Italy,” said he; “your father fell in the battle
of Minden; and now I will not be accessory to the
ruin of the only remaining branch of the family.”</p>

<div id='i024'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i-024.jpg' alt='De Kalb' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>But nothing could quench the ardor of the dauntless
La Fayette. He found in the Baron de Kalb a kindred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>sympathy, and through the baron, the Marquis de La
Fayette was introduced to Mr. Silas Deane, who had
been sent by the American Congress to negotiate with
the French government. La Fayette made known to
Mr. Deane his generous desire to offer his personal services
in the American war. Whereupon Mr. Deane gave
to him the following paper:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“The desire which the Marquis de La Fayette shows
of serving among the troops of the United States of
North America, and the interest which he takes in the
justice of their cause, makes him wish to distinguish
himself in this war, and to render himself as useful as
he possibly can. But not thinking that he can obtain
leave of his family to pass the seas and to serve in a
foreign country till he can go as a general officer, I have
thought that I could not better serve my country and
those who have entrusted me, than by granting to him,
in the name of the very honorable Congress, the rank of
major-general, which I beg the states to confirm and
ratify to him, and to deliver him the commission to hold
and take rank from this day with the general officers of
the same degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His high birth, his alliances, the great dignities
which his family hold at this court, his considerable
estates in this realm, his personal merit, his reputation,
his disinterestedness, and above all, his zeal for the liberty
of our provinces, are such as to induce me alone to
promise him the rank of major-general in the name of
the United States. In witness of which I have signed
these presents this 7th day of December, 1776.</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Silas Deane.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“The secrecy,” says La Fayette, “with which this
negotiation and my preparations were made, appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>almost a miracle; family, friends, ministers, French
spies, and English spies, all were kept completely in the
dark as to my intentions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But just at this time news of disastrous defeats in
the Revolutionary army reached France. The bells of
London rang out joyful peals at this welcome intelligence;
but many sympathizing hearts in Paris saddened
at this dire misfortune to the little band fighting for
their rightful independence. The court of Versailles
had not yet openly espoused the American cause, and
now Louis XVI. and others, friendly to the Americans,
waited for more encouraging prospects before lending
their aid. But not so the liberty-loving La Fayette.
He was never so great as when in the midst of the most
stupendous difficulties, and he was never so true and
faithful and staunch in his patriotic principles, as when
the cause to which he was attached hung trembling betwixt
victory and defeat. Discouragements but nerved
him to new ardor; obstacles but strengthened his determination
to overcome every barrier in the way of his successful
progress. His was truly a soul and nature most
eminently fitted for the important part he was called
upon to take in the struggle for liberty and freedom.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this time affairs in the new world were in a most
desperate condition. The battle of Brooklyn had been
fought, resulting in the total rout of the continental
forces, and the evacuation of Long Island. New York,
after an heroic resistance, had been given up to the
British. General Howe was master of Forts Washington
and Lee. General Washington, with the remnants of
the army, with tattered uniforms and scanty food, was
retreating before the foe. The country was in despair.
Dark indeed were the clouds which threw their shadows
over sorrowful homes and the suffering patriots of the
struggling nation.</p>
<div id='i028'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i-028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>LOUIS XVI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Even the American commissioners at Paris were paralyzed
by this dreadful blow. They dared not urge the
French further in the behalf of their stricken country,
which seemed doomed to defeat. They even counselled
La Fayette to abandon his project of enlisting in their
cause, representing to him that their affairs were now so
desperate that they could not offer him a passage to
America, nor any assurance of success should he venture
to go. But La Fayette’s love of liberty was not dependent
upon success or defeat. His principles were as
unflinching in disaster as when crowned with victory;
and to La Fayette’s courage America in a large measure
owes her ultimate success. Study the history of those
times, and then try to answer the question, What
would have been the result of the American Revolution,
without the aid of La Fayette?</p>

<p class='c010'>To the discouraged commissioners, La Fayette made
this noble reply:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you for your frankness, but now is precisely
the moment to serve your cause; the more people are
discouraged, the greater utility will result from my departure.
Until now you have only seen my ardor in
your cause, but that may not prove at present wholly
useless. If you cannot furnish me with a vessel, I will
purchase one and freight it at my own expense, to convey
your despatches and my person to the shores of
America.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With unflagging labor La Fayette now occupied himself
in carrying out his promised plan. From his own
estates he raised the money necessary for the expedition,
and prepared to purchase and equip a vessel. King Louis,
owing to the recent reverses in America, began to distrust
the expediency of an open alliance. La Fayette,
being suspected of favoring the American cause, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>constantly watched by French and English spies. To
escape the knowledge of his family and the royal surveillance,
the ship was purchased through La Fayette’s
friend, Mr. Duboismartin, who warmly sympathized with
his liberal principles. In the midst of these preparations
La Fayette was sent by the French government
on a diplomatic mission to London. Lest he should
excite suspicion by refusal, La Fayette departed for England
with his associate, the Prince de Poix. On reaching
London, it was a significant fact that before La Fayette
paid his respects to the British court, he sought an interview
with Bancroft, <em>the American</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was received at the English court with
every mark of distinguished honor, but court flatteries
were little now to his taste. He was yearning to return
to Paris, to continue his preparations for his chivalrous
project.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the end of three weeks,” he writes, “when it
became necessary for me to return home, while refusing
to accompany my uncle, the ambassador, to court, I confided
to him my strong desire to take a trip to Paris.
He suggested that he should say that I was ill during
my absence. I should not have made use of this stratagem
myself, but did not object to his doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hastening back to Paris, he continued his secret preparations.
Without making known his return to any of
his friends, with the exception of those interested in
his plans, La Fayette set out for Bordeaux, where a
ship was being equipped for him. But information regarding
his mysterious man&oelig;uvres was now communicated
to the court of Versailles, and led to an order for his
arrest. La Fayette, being warned, departed to Passage,
a Spanish port, intending to embark for America from
there. He now openly avowed his intentions, and declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that nothing should induce him to relinquish his
plans.</p>

<div id='i032'  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i-032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>MARIE ANTOINETTE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But now his firmness was put to the severest test.
Letters arrived from his family, containing the bitterest
reproaches. He was even accused of want of parental
care and gross neglect of his wife and home. This was
indeed hard to bear. La Fayette was deeply in love
with his winsome and affectionate wife. But with an
unselfishness which amounted to the sublimity of heroism,
his young wife restrained her tears, lest he should
be blamed, and bravely determined to bear the parting
uncomplainingly. Such a heroine as she afterwards
proved herself to be made her a truly worthy companion
for her hero-husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>Letters came, also, under kingly authority, forbidding
his embarkation for America, threatening severe displeasure
in case of disobedience. Sovereign displeasure,
La Fayette was well aware, meant liability to the confiscation
of all his property, and public disgrace. Feigning
obedience, La Fayette returned to Bordeaux, and
wrote to the ministry, requesting permission to carry out
his plans, representing the benefits which France would
derive by the wresting of this coveted land from proud
England. But the king was not prepared to excite the
wrath of his powerful neighbor, and no reply was sent
directly to La Fayette, though he was made to understand,
through friends, that his petition had been refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shortly afterwards received orders to proceed to
Marseilles, and join himself to the Duke d’Ayen, who
was going into Italy. La Fayette now determined to
brave all hazards. He accordingly departed ostensibly
for Marseilles, but soon changed his route and went
directly to Passage, and there embarked on his gallant
ship <em>Victory</em>, and unfurled the sails, pointing the prow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of his vessel towards the land of liberty. As soon as it
was ascertained that La Fayette had gone, despatches
were sent to arrest him at the West Indies. But La
Fayette, suspecting this, ordered his captain to steer
directly for America.</p>

<p class='c010'>His wearisome voyage lasted for two months. Seasickness
added its discomforts to the anxieties, regrets,
and aspiring longings which made keen warfare in his
saddened heart. Would his wife forgive him for this
seeming desertion? Would his country renounce him?
Would his unselfish and magnanimous sacrifice avail in
the cause of liberty, which was the ruling passion of his
life? Weak with sickness and tempest-tossed, he addressed
to his wife these pathetic letters:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“On board the <em>Victory</em>, May 30, 1777.</div>

<p class='c010'>“... How many fears and anxieties enhance the keen
anguish I feel at being separated from all that I love
most fondly in the world! How have you borne my
second departure? Have you loved me less? Have you
pardoned me? Have you reflected that, at all events, I
must equally have been parted from you—wandering
about in Italy, dragging on an inglorious life, surrounded
by the persons most opposed to my projects and to my
manner of thinking? All these reflections did not prevent
me from experiencing the most bitter grief when
the moment arrived for quitting my native shores. Your
sorrow, and that of my friends, all rushed upon my
thoughts; and my heart was torn by a thousand painful
feelings. I could not, at that instant, find any excuse
for my own conduct. If you could know all that I have
suffered, and the melancholy days that I have passed
while thus flying from all that I love best in the world!
Must I join to this affliction the grief of hearing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>you do not pardon me? I should, in truth, my love, be
too unhappy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Again he writes:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“On board the <em>Victory</em>, June 7.</div>

<p class='c010'>“I am still floating upon this dreary plain, the most
wearisome of all human habitations. To console myself
a little I think of you and of my friends. I think of the
pleasure of seeing you again. How delightful will be
the moment of my arrival! I shall hasten to surprise
and embrace you. I shall, perhaps, find you with your
children. To think, only, of that happy moment is an
inexpressible pleasure to me—do not fancy that it is
distant; although the time of my absence will appear,
I confess, very long to me, yet we shall meet sooner than
you can expect. While defending the liberty which I
adore, I shall enjoy perfect freedom myself; I but offer
my services to that interesting Republic from motives of
the purest kind, unmixed with ambition or private views;
her happiness and my glory are my only incentives to
the task. I hope, that for my sake, you will become a
good American, for that feeling is worthy of every noble
heart. The happiness of America is intimately connected
with the happiness of all mankind. She will
become the safe and respected asylum of virtue, integrity,
toleration, equality, and tranquil happiness.”</p>

      <div class='line'>“When Freedom from her mountain height</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Unfurled her standard to the air,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>ON the 14th of June, 1777, La Fayette landed at
Winyau Bay, about sixty miles northeast from
Charleston. Nature had clothed herself in her loveliest
garb to welcome the knight of liberty who had sacrificed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>wealth and luxury and the gay life of courts, to
unsheathe his sword in this new land in defence of
freedom.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was midnight under the soft June skies. The stars
glowed in benediction, and the moon shed a calm radiance
over the scene. As the canoe conveyed the travellers
up the picturesque bay, the wooded land beyond
seemed to stretch out its leafy hands of welcome, and
the air was perfumed with the delicious fragrance of
innumerable flowers. Such was America’s greeting to
her brave defender.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of this, let La Fayette’s own letters speak. Back to
the love of his heart, the wife whose constant devotion
was his guiding star, fly quickly his thoughts, on the
swift wings of affection, and he hastens to pen these
lines:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>June 19.</span></div>

<p class='c010'>“I landed at Charleston, after having sailed for several
days along a coast swarming with hostile vessels.
On my arrival here every one told me that my ship
would undoubtedly be taken, because two English frigates
had blockaded the harbor. I even sent, both by
land and by sea, orders to the captain to put the men on
shore, and burn the vessels, if he had still the power
of doing so. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Eh bien!</em></span> by a most extraordinary piece
of good fortune, a sudden gale of wind having blown
away the frigates for a short time, my vessel arrived at
noonday, without having encountered friend or foe.
At Charleston I have met General Howe, a general
officer now engaged in service. The governor of the
state is expected this evening from the country. All
the persons with whom I wished to be acquainted have
shown me the greatest attention and politeness—not
European politeness merely. I can only feel gratitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>for the reception tendered me, although I have not
yet thought proper to enter into any details respecting
my future prospects and arrangements. I wish to see
the Congress first. I hope to set out in two days for
Philadelphia, which is a land journey of more than two
hundred and fifty leagues. We shall divide into small
parties. I have already purchased horses and light carriages
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall now speak to you, my love, about the country
and its inhabitants, who are as agreeable as my enthusiasm
led me to imagine. Simplicity of manner, kindness
of heart, love of country and of liberty, and a
delightful state of equality are universal. The richest
and the poorest men are completely on a level; and,
although there are some immense fortunes in this country,
I may challenge any one to point out the slightest
difference in their respective manner toward each other.
I first saw and judged of a country life at Major Huger’s
house. I am at present in this city, where I notice a
resemblance to English customs, except that I find more
simplicity here than in England.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Charleston is one of the best built, handsomest, and
most agreeable cities that I have ever seen. The American
women are very pretty, and have great simplicity of
character. The extreme neatness of their appearance is
truly delightful. Cleanliness is everywhere even more
studiously regarded here than in England. What gave
me most pleasure is to see how completely the citizens
are all brethren of one family. In America there appear
to be none poor, and none even who can be called peasants.
Each citizen has some property, and all citizens have the
same rights as the richest individual or landed proprietor
in the country. The inns are very different from
those in Europe; the host and hostess sit at table with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>you, and do the honors of a comfortable meal, and when
you depart you pay your bill without being obliged to
fee attendants. If you dislike going to inns, you always
find country houses, in which you will be received as a
good American, with the same attention that you expect
to find at a friend’s house in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My own reception has been peculiarly agreeable.
To have been merely my travelling companion suffices
to secure the kindest welcome. I have just passed
five hours at a large dinner, given in compliment to
me by an individual of this town. Generals Howe and
Moultrie, and several officers of my suite, were present.
We drank each other’s health, and endeavored to
talk English, which I am beginning to speak a little. I
shall pay a visit to-morrow, with these gentlemen, to the
governor of the state, and make the last arrangements
for my departure. The next day the commanding officer
here will take me to see the town and its environs, and I
shall then set out to join the army.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the agreeable life I lead in this country, from
the sympathy which makes me feel as much at ease with
the inhabitants as if I had known them twenty years,
the similarity between their manner of thinking and my
own, my love of glory and liberty, you might imagine
that I am very happy; but you are not with me, my
dearest love; my friends are not with me; and there is
no happiness for me when far away from you and them.
I often ask you if you still love, but I put that question
still more often to myself, and my heart ever
answers yes. I trust that my heart does not deceive
me. I am inexpressibly anxious to hear from you, and
hope to find some letters at Philadelphia. My only fear
is lest the privateer which was to bring them to me may
have been captured on her way. Although I can easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>imagine that I have excited the special displeasure of
the English, by taking the liberty of coming hither in
spite of them and landing before their very face, yet I
must confess that we shall be even more than on a par if
they succeed in catching that vessel, the object of my
fondest hopes, by which I am expecting to receive your
letters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I entreat you to send me both long and frequent letters.
You are not sufficiently conscious of the joy with
which I shall receive them. Embrace, most tenderly,
my Henriette; may I add, embrace our children! The
father of those poor children is a wanderer, but he is,
nevertheless, a good, honest man, a good father, warmly
attached to his family, and a good husband also, for he
loves his wife most tenderly. The night is far advanced,
the heat intense, and I am devoured by mosquitoes; but
the best countries, as you perceive, have their inconveniences.
Adieu, my love, adieu.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Again La Fayette writes to his wife from Petersburg,
Va., July 17, 1777:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am now eight days’ journey from Philadelphia, in
the beautiful state of Virginia. All fatigue is over, and
I fear that my martial labors will be very light if it be
true that General Howe has left New York, to go I know
not whither. But all the accounts I receive are so uncertain
that I cannot form any fixed opinion until I reach
my destination.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have learned the particulars of the beginning
of my journey. You know that I set out in a
brilliant manner, in a carriage, and I must now tell you
that we are all on horseback,—having broken the carriage
according to my usual praiseworthy custom,—and
I expect soon to write to you that we have arrived on foot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The journey is somewhat fatiguing; but, although several
of my comrades have suffered a great deal, I have
scarcely, myself, been conscious of fatigue. The captain,
who takes charge of this letter, will perhaps pay you a
visit. I beg you, in that case, to receive him with great
kindness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The farther I advance to the north, the better pleased
I am with the country and its inhabitants. There is no
attention or kindness that I do not receive, although
many scarcely know who I am. But I will write all this
to you more in detail from Philadelphia.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as La Fayette arrived in Philadelphia, he presented
himself before Congress, then in session. The
moment was inauspicious. Mr. Deane had given so
many foreigners the same promises, that Congress found
itself in a very embarrassing situation. Many of these
foreigners were brave men, and true, who had come to
America with philanthropic motives, but others were
mere adventurers, and Congress therefore received the
young Marquis de La Fayette with coldness and indifference,
which he illy deserved, and which in the light of
after events proved a mortifying mistake. La Fayette
laid his stipulations with Mr. Deane before Congress,
but, with surprise and chagrin, he was informed by the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that there
was little hope that his request would be granted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Imagine the feelings of the noble young marquis of
nineteen. He had sacrificed home, family, friends, and
fortune, to give his aid to this struggling nation, and his
immense personal sacrifices were thus insultingly thrown
into his face. What blindness in Congress! What heroic
magnanimity in La Fayette! Pride and patriotism battled
in his sensitive soul. But unselfish patriotism conquered,
and never does he appear more truly great than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>at this moment. Seizing a pen, he writes to Congress
this brief but immortal note:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“After the sacrifices I have made, I have a right to
exact two favors: one is, to serve at my <em>own expense</em>;
the other is, to serve as a <em>volunteer</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Astonished at such unprecedented generosity, and <a id='corr24.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='concious'>conscious</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_24.6'><ins class='correction' title='concious'>conscious</ins></a></span>
of their mistake in classing the young marquis
with other foreigners, who were actuated by selfish
avarice and love of adventure, Congress accordingly
passed the following preamble and resolution on the 31st
of July, 1777:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Whereas</em>, the Marquis de La Fayette, out of his great zeal
in the cause of liberty in which the United States are engaged,
has left his family and connections, and, at his own expense,
come over to offer his service to the United States, without pension
or particular allowance, and is anxious to risk his life in
our cause;</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That his services be accepted, and that in consideration
of his zeal, illustrious family and connections, he have
the rank and commission of a Major-General in the army of the
United States.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s first meeting with Washington was at a
dinner party in Philadelphia, on the 1st of August.
The commander-in-chief looked with sympathy upon the
noble young hero, and their hearts were quickly united
in a bond of friendship which ignored diversity of age,
country, and experience, for they mutually recognized a
self-sacrificing devotion to the sacred and sublime cause
of human liberty.</p>

<div id='i044'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i-044.jpg' alt='G&thinsp;o. Washington' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“When the company were about to separate, Washington
took La Fayette aside, spoke to him very kindly,
complimented him on the noble spirit he had shown, and
the sacrifices he had made in favor of the American
cause, and then told him that he should be pleased if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>would make the headquarters of the commander-in-chief
his home, establish himself there whenever he thought
proper, and consider himself at all times as one of his
family; adding in a tone of pleasantry, that he could not
promise him the luxuries of a court, or even the conveniences
which his former habits might have rendered
essential to comfort; but since he had become an American
soldier he would doubtless contrive to accommodate
himself to the character he had assumed, and submit
with a good grace to the customs, manners, and privations
of the republican army.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Little was the bold spirit of La Fayette dismayed at
the prospect of difficulties and privations. His soul
could not be confined by hardships, dangers, or even
defeats. He eagerly accepted the invitation of Washington,
and well repaid his kindly courtesy. It was
about this time that the following letter was written
from Paris by Franklin to Washington:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: The Marquis de La Fayette, a young nobleman
of great expectations and exceedingly beloved here, is by
this time probably with you. By some misapprehension
in his contract with the merchants of Bordeaux he was
prevented from using the produce of the cargo he carried
over, and so was left without a supply of money.
His friends here have sent him over about £500 sterling,
and have proposed sending him more; but on
reflection, knowing the extreme generosity of his disposition,
and fearing that some of his necessitous and artful
countrymen may impose on his goodness, they wish
to put his money into the hands of some discreet friend,
who may supply him from time to time, and by that
means knowing his expenses, may take occasion to advise
him if necessary, from too much imposition.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“They accordingly have desired us to name such a
person to them. We have not been able to think of one
so capable and so suitable from the influence of situation
to perform that kind office as General Washington,
under whose eye the gentleman will probably be.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We beg, therefore, in his behalf, what his friends
out of respect would not take the liberty of asking, that
Your Excellency would be pleased to furnish him with
what money he may want in moderation, and take his
drafts payable to us for sums paid him, which we shall
receive here, and apply to the public service.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We also join with his family in their earnest request
that you would favor him with your counsels, which you
may be assured will be an act of benevolence gratefully remembered
and acknowledged by a number of very worthy
persons here who have interested themselves extremely
in the welfare of that amiable young nobleman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With the greatest respect we have the honor to be,
Sir, Your Excellency’s.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The commission which La Fayette had received from
Congress was, as yet, only an honorary one, conferring
upon him no real command. La Fayette was now with
Washington at his headquarters. He was yearning for
active duties, and impatient to prove by personal exploits
his zeal in the cause of liberty. Washington wrote to
Congress regarding La Fayette’s position, but received
the unsatisfactory reply, “that the commission given to
the Marquis de La Fayette was only honorary, and that
he could not yet receive an appointment.” Again did
the generous spirit of the young hero meet only a cold
rebuff in answer to his warm offers of personal service.
He determined now to win his position by his own
actions, and the opportunity was not long in arriving.</p>
<div id='i048'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i-048.jpg' alt='Benj. Franklin' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>On the 11th of September, 1777, was fought the battle
of Brandywine. “The British fleet under Sir William
Howe, whose movements along the American coast at
one time seeming to threaten Philadelphia, and at another
appearing to meditate an attack upon Charleston,
had caused much apprehension and doubt, had, at last,
entered the Chesapeake; and, having proceeded up the
Elk River as far as it was safely navigable, landed the
forces at the ferry on the 25th of August. The determination
of an assault upon Philadelphia was no longer questionable.
The day before Sir William Howe landed,
General Washington, to inspire the citizens with confidence,
paraded his troops through the streets of Philadelphia,
and then proceeded boldly to the Brandywine.
The popular clamor, favored by the voice of Congress,
demanded a battle, and Washington determined to risk
one, though he greatly apprehended that he could not
successfully compete with the strength of the battalions
marching against him. But a battle, though disastrous,
would be less injurious than to suffer the enemy to
advance to Philadelphia without opposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Washington, having halted for a few days on the
banks of the Brandywine to refresh his troops, and get
a better knowledge of the face of the country and the
plans of the enemy, sent forward two divisions under
Green and Stephens, who proceeded nearer to the head
of the Elk, and encamped behind White Clay Creek.
Three miles farther on, at Iron Hill, was stationed General
Maxwell, at the head of an effective corps of light
infantry, formed from a regiment of Morgan’s riflemen,
which had been detached to the northern army.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Posting the cavalry along the lines, Washington, with
the main body, crossed the Brandywine, and took up his
position behind Red Clay Creek, on the road which Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>William Howe would have to traverse on his march to
Philadelphia. La Fayette was with him, and watched
with the liveliest interest the preparations for the approaching
contest. These were made with consummate
adroitness and prudence; but Sir William Howe was no
common foe; and the direction which he seemed contemplating
for his vastly superior force decided Washington
that a change of his own position was necessary.
A council of war was held on the night of the 9th of
September, when it was determined to retire behind the
Brandywine, and meet the enemy near Chadd’s Ford,
from the heights which ranged along upon the opposite
side of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the morning of the 11th of September, soon after
daybreak, La Fayette sprang to his feet at the intelligence
that the whole British army was in motion, and
advancing towards them on the direct road leading over
Chadd’s Ford. General Maxwell had been advantageously
stationed, so that he could command this road
from the hills, on the south side of the river; and the
first action accordingly began with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The foe advanced in two magnificent columns, the
right commanded by General Knyphausen, and the left
by Lord Cornwallis. The plan of Howe was, that Knyphausen’s
division should occupy the attention of the
Americans, by making repeated feints of attempting the
passage of the ford, while Cornwallis should make a
long sweep up the river, and cross it at Birmingham.
Knyphausen accordingly advanced with his column,
and speedily dislodging General Maxwell from his post,
forced him to cross over, though with but little loss. A
furious cannonading was instantly begun, and other
demonstrations made, which indicated the intention of
the British immediately to attempt the passage of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>ford. The day was occupied in preventing this, till
eleven o’clock in the morning, when the movement of
Cornwallis was first announced to Washington. A smile
of delight played upon his countenance, and he immediately
determined upon one of those bold but judicious
plans for which he was remarkable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Placing himself at the head of the centre and left
wing of the army, he resolved to cross the river in person,
and overwhelm Knyphausen before Cornwallis could
be summoned back to his aid. His ranks were already
formed for the passage, and his troops had answered to
the proposition with deafening shouts, when a messenger
arrived with the intelligence that Cornwallis had only
made a feint of crossing the fords above, and was now
actually bringing his division down the southern side of
the river, to re-unite with Knyphausen. The tidings
were agony to Washington; though, false, they came in
a form which constrained him to believe them true, and
his bold project was accordingly abandoned. His troops
were impatient for the encounter, but for two hours he
could only give them quiet directions, while he endeavored,
in distressing suspense, to gain some clew to the
movements of the enemy on the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At about two o’clock in the afternoon his uncertainty
was removed, when certain intelligence reached
him, that Lord Cornwallis, after having made a circuit
of nearly seventeen miles, had forded the river above its
forks, and, accompanied by Sir William Howe, was advancing
upon him. Close action was immediately prepared
for, and all along the American lines ran the
accents of welcome for the conflict. The three divisions
which formed the right wing, under Generals Sullivan,
Stirling, and Stephens, were detached, and, moving up
the Brandywine, fronted the British column marching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>down the river. Selecting an advantageous piece of
ground near Birmingham, with the river on their left,
and, having both flanks covered by a thick wood, they
hastily formed and awaited the attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette, who had kept by the side of Washington
during these scenes, and marked them with absorbing
interest, soon saw that the divisions designed to meet
Cornwallis were to receive most of the heavy blows of
that day’s battle, and petitioned and obtained permission
to join them. A burst of enthusiasm greeted his arrival,
as he threw himself into the midst of the troops, eagerly
awaiting the approach of the foe. The opportunity
which he sought was not wanting long. The host was
visible, sweeping in grand and imposing array over the
plain before them. When he saw the enemy, Lord
Cornwallis formed in the finest order, and hastening
forward, his first line opened a brisk fire of musketry
and artillery upon them. It was about half-past four
when the battle began. The Americans returned the fire
with great injury, but the impetuosity with which the
English and Hessian troops threw themselves upon their
ranks was more than they could withstand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For a time both parties fought with unparalleled
bravery, and the carnage was terrible. For some time
it was a doubtful struggle, but the fiery emulation which
stimulated the English and the Hessians at last compelled
the Americans to give way before them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The right wing first yielded, then the left, while the
central division, where La Fayette was bravely fighting,
was the last to breast the storm, which now, concentrating
its strength, spent its fury upon those devoted ranks.
Firm as a rock, they bore themselves proudly against
the tide of victory, which rolled in fearfully upon them.
By a skilful man&oelig;uvre, Cornwallis had managed to separate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>them from the two wings, when defeat became
inevitable. The whole fire of the enemy was united
against them, and the confusion became extreme. The
troops at first wavered, then rallied, then wavered again,
and at last fell into a disorderly retreat. It was in vain
that La Fayette endeavored to check them; defying danger,
he stood almost single-handed against the on-coming
host, and endeavored to reanimate his flying comrades
by his own example. It was all fruitless. A ball struck
him, and as he fell, those remaining on the field gave
way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gimat, aide-de-camp to the Marquis, assisted his master
in getting upon a horse, and, though the blood was
flowing profusely from his wound, La Fayette reluctantly
turned and joined the fugitives. General Washington at
this moment arrived with fresh troops upon the field.
Greene’s divisions had marched four miles <em>in forty-two
minutes</em>, but were too late to avert the disasters of the
day. La Fayette, as soon as he saw Washington, started
to join him, but loss of blood obliged him to stop and
have his wound bandaged. While submitting to this a
band of soldiers came upon him so suddenly that he had
barely time to remount for flight, escaping, as by a miracle,
the shower of bullets which whistled around his
form.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A general rout was the order of the day. The road
to Chester was crowded with the retreating. Knyphausen
had forced the passage of Chadd’s Ford, notwithstanding
the obstinate resistance of Generals Wayne and
Maxwell, who had been left to defend it. Washington
found that all that could be done was to stay the pursuit.
So successful were his efforts, and those of General
Greene, that, as night approached, Sir William Howe
called in his troops and gave over the chase. La Fayette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>was unwearied in his endeavors to save the army. Forgetting
himself, his wound, and everything but this one
object, he exerted himself to the utmost amid the darkness
and dreadful confusion of that night, to restore
order among the fleeing and despairing soldiery. At
Chester Bridge, twelve miles from the scene of battle, he
was in part successful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The generals and the commander-in-chief arrived, and
La Fayette, at last fainting from loss of blood and fatigue,
was borne away to receive the attention which his
situation demanded. The next day he wrote to his wife
as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, Sept. 12th.</div>

<p class='c010'>“I must begin by telling you that I am perfectly well,
because I must end by telling you that we fought seriously
last night, and that we were not the stronger party
on the field of battle. Our Americans, after having stood
their ground for some time, ended at length by being
routed. While endeavoring to rally them, the English
honored me with a musket ball, which slightly wounded
me in the leg; but it is a trifle, my dearest love: the ball
touched neither bone nor nerve, and I have escaped with
the obligation of lying upon my back for some time, which
puts me much out of humor. I hope you will feel no
anxiety. This event ought, on the contrary, rather to
reassure you, since I am incapacitated from appearing
on the field for some time. I have resolved to take great
care of myself; be convinced of this, my love. This
affair will, I fear, be attended with bad consequences for
America, but we will endeavor, if possible, to repair the
evil. You must have received many letters from me, unless
the English be as ill-disposed towards my epistles as
towards my legs. I have not yet received one letter, and
I am most impatient to hear from you. It is dreadful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>be reduced to hold no communication except by letter
with a person whom one loves as I love you, and as I
shall ever love you, until I draw my latest breath. I
have not missed a single opportunity, not even the most
indirect one, of writing to you. Do the same on your
part, my dearest life, if you love me. Adieu; I am forbidden
to write longer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>After the battle of Brandywine Congress adjourned to
Bristol, as Philadelphia was thought to be in danger; and
La Fayette was carried to Bethlehem and placed in the
care of the Moravian Society until his wound should be
healed. In October he thus wrote to his wife:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wrote to you, my dearest love, the 12th of September;
the twelfth was the day after the eleventh, and
I have a little tale to relate to you concerning that eleventh
day. To render my action more meritorious, I might
tell you that prudent reflections induced me to remain
for some weeks in bed, safe sheltered from all danger;
but I must acknowledge that I was encouraged to
take this measure by a slight wound which I met with, I
know not how, for I did not, in truth, expose myself to
peril. It was the first conflict at which I had been present;
so you see how very rare engagements are. It will
be the last of this campaign, or, in all probability, at least,
the last great battle; and if anything should occur, you
see that I could not myself be present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My first occupation was to write you the day after
that affair; I told you that it was a mere trifle, and I was
right; all I fear is, that you may not have received my
letter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As General Howe is giving, meanwhile, rather pompous
details of his American exploits to the king his
master, if he should write that I am wounded, he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>also write that I am killed, which would not cost him
anything; but I hope that my friends, and you especially,
will not give faith to the reports of those persons
who last year dared to publish that General Washington
and all the general officers of his army, being in a
boat together, had been upset, and every individual
drowned. But let us speak about the wound: it is
only a flesh wound, and has touched neither bone nor
nerve. The surgeons are astonished at the rapidity
with which it heals; they are in an ecstasy of joy each
time they dress it, and pretend it is the finest thing in
the world. For my part, I think it most disagreeable,
painful, and wearisome; but tastes often differ. If a
man, however, wished to be wounded for his amusement
only, he should come and examine how I have been
struck, that he might be struck precisely in the same
manner. This, my dearest love, is what I pompously
style my wound, to give myself airs and render myself
interesting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must now give you your lesson as wife of an
American general officer. They will say to you, ‘They
have been beaten’; you must answer, ‘That is true; but
when two armies of <em>equal number</em> meet in the field, old
soldiers have naturally the advantage over new ones;
they have, besides, had the pleasure of killing a great
many of the enemy, many more than they have lost!’
They will afterwards add, ‘All this is very well; but
Philadelphia is taken, the capital of America, the rampart
of liberty!’ You must politely answer: ‘You are all
great fools! Philadelphia is a poor, forlorn town, exposed
on every side, the harbor of which was already closed;
though the residence of Congress lent it—I know not
why—some degree of celebrity.’ This is the famous
city which, be it added, we shall, sooner or later, make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>them yield back to us. If they continue to persecute
you with questions, you may send them about their business
in terms which the Vicomte de Noailles will teach
you, for I cannot lose time by talking to you of politics.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be perfectly at ease about my wound; all the faculty
in America are engaged in my service. I have a friend
who has spoken to them in such a manner that I am
certain of being well attended to. That friend is General
Washington. This excellent man, whose talents
and virtues I admired, and whom I have learned to
revere as I know him better, has now become my intimate
friend. His affectionate interest in me instantly
won my heart. I am established in his house, and we
live together like two attached brothers, with mutual
confidence and cordiality. This friendship renders me
as happy as I can possibly be in this country. When he
sent his best surgeon to me, he told him to take charge
of me as if I were his son, because he loved me with
the same affection. Having heard that I wished to rejoin
the army too soon, he wrote me a letter full of tenderness,
in which he requested me to attend to the perfect
restoration of my health. I give you these details,
my dearest love, that you may feel quite certain of the
care which is taken of me. Among the French officers
who have all expressed the warmest interest in me, M.
de Gimat, my aide-de-camp, has followed me about like
my shadow, both before and since the battle, and has
given me every possible proof of attachment. You may
thus feel quite secure on this account, both for the present
and the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am at present in the solitude of Bethlehem, which
the Abbé Raynal has described so minutely. This establishment
is a very interesting one; the fraternity
lead an agreeable and very tranquil life—but we will talk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>over all this on my return. I intend to weary those I
love, yourself, of course, in the first place, by the relation
of my adventures, for you know that I was always
a great chatterbox.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must become a prattler also, my love, and say
many things for me to Henriette—my poor little Henriette!
embrace her a thousand times; talk of me to
her, but do not tell her all I deserve to suffer: my
punishment will be, not to be recognized by her on my
arrival; that is the penance Henriette will impose upon
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the life of Madame de La Fayette, written by her
daughter, Madame de Lasteyrie, this touching account is
given of La Fayette’s wife at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the month of April, 1777, my father carried out
his plan of going to America. It is easy to judge of my
mother’s grief on receiving tidings so new, so unexpected,
and so terrible. In addition to all she was herself
suffering; she had the pain of witnessing my grandfather’s
anger. ‘The French ladies,’ Lord Stomont, the
English ambassador, wrote to his government, ‘blame
M. de La Fayette’s family, for having tried to stop him
in so noble an enterprise. If the Duc d’Ayen,’ one of
them said, ‘crosses such a son-in-law in such an attempt,
he must not hope to find husbands for his other daughters.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother felt that the more she excited pity, the
more my father would be censured. All her endeavors
were then to conceal the tortures of her heart, preferring
to be thought childish or indifferent to bringing down
greater blame on his behavior. My mother found much
comfort in the kindness shown to her by my grandmother,
whose noble mind made her appreciate each
detail of her son-in-law’s conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“It was with truly maternal tenderness that she broke
to her daughter the different accounts of my father’s
departure, of his arrest, of his return to Bordeaux, and
of his ultimate embarkation at the Port du Passage in
Spain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first accounts of my father’s arrival in America
reached my mother a month after the birth of my sister
Anastasie. His charming letters, the accounts of his
deeds, the success he had already achieved, caused her
a delight mingled with apprehensions for the dangers
of war. The news of my father having been wounded
at the battle of Brandywine reached my mother’s ears,
but still more alarming reports were hidden from her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After being wounded at Brandywine, La Fayette heard
of the birth of his second daughter, Anastasie. He thus
tenderly wrote to his adored wife:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“How happy your safety has made me. Dearest heart,
I must speak of it all through my letter, for I can think
of nothing else. What rapture to embrace you all,—the
mother and the two little girls,—to make them
intercede with you for their truant father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning this first visit of La Fayette to America
Madame de La Fayette herself thus writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. de La Fayette executed in April the scheme he
had been forming for six months past, of going to serve
the cause of independence in America. I loved him tenderly.
On hearing the news of his departure, my father
and all the family fell into a state of violent anger. My
mother, dreading these emotions for me, on account of
the state of health I was in, alarmed at the dangers her
dearly beloved son had gone to seek so far, having herself,
less than anybody in the world, the thirst of ambition
and of worldly glory or a taste for enterprise,
appreciated, nevertheless, M. de La Fayette’s conduct as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>it was appreciated two years later by the rest of the
world. Totally casting aside all care with regard to the
immense expense of such an enterprise, she found, from
the first moment, in the manner in which it had been
prepared, a motive for distinguishing it from what is
termed <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>une folie de jeune homme</em></span>. His sorrow on leaving
his wife and those who were dear to him convinced
her that she need not fear for the happiness of my life
save in proportion to her fears for his. It was she
who gave me the cruel news of his departure, and,
with that generous tenderness which was peculiar to
her, she tried to comfort me by finding the means of
serving M. de La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At that time my mother’s youngest sister married
M. de Ségur, one of M. de La Fayette’s friends. My
mother devoted to her all the moments she could dispose
of, but I was still the continual object of her solicitude.
She saw how much good she did me by showing her
affection for M. de La Fayette. Whenever M. de La
Fayette’s touching letters reached us, I could see how
thoroughly she believed in his tenderness for me. At
the end of two months my dear Anastasie was born. It
seemed as if I already foresaw what a gift God was
bestowing on me; from the first moment of her birth
I felt that in the midst of the greatest trials I was
still capable of joy. My child received her grandmother’s
blessing, and was carried by her to the baptismal
font.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first news from M. de La Fayette arrived on the
first of August, one month after Anastasie’s birth. The
comfort it gave me was fully shared. My mother was
indefatigable in her efforts to obtain some accounts of
him, to send him news from us, and to make herself useful
to him though separated by so great a distance. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>few details which reached us respecting his arrival, and
the favorable impression he had made on the public mind
in America, did not surprise my mother, but renewed her
courage and made her still more thankful to Providence
who was so visibly protecting and guiding him. But
shortly afterwards we heard that M. de La Fayette had
been wounded at the battle of Brandywine. I need not
say what were my mother’s feelings on hearing such
intelligence. She succeeded in keeping from me the
report of his death, which was spread about at that
time, and to prevent false news from reaching my ear;
she first took me to her father’s place in Burgundy, and
then sent my sister and me on a visit to the Comtesse
Auguste de La Marck, at Raismes. The Comte de La
Marck was Mirabeau’s friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the winter of 1778 my mother turned all her
efforts towards obtaining intelligence from America. We
heard occasionally from M. de La Fayette. The alliance
between France and the United States caused my mother
great satisfaction; I had never seen her take such interest
in any political event.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus tenderly this young wife of eighteen was shielded
by her mother’s care during this trying absence of the
young husband whom she so adored. Regarding the unusual
and ideal love existing between La Fayette and
his devoted wife in their early married life, their
daughter Virginie, afterwards the Marquise de Lasteyrie,
thus writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not think it is possible to have an idea of my
mother’s way of loving. It was peculiar to herself. Her
affection for my father predominated over every other
feeling without diminishing any. It might be said she
felt for him the most passionate attachment, if that
expression was in harmony with the exquisite delicacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>which kept her from any sort of jealousy, or, at least,
from any of those evil impulses generally attendant upon
that feeling. Neither had she ever a moment of <em>exigence</em>.
Not only was it impossible for my father ever to perceive
a wish that could be unwelcome to him, but, even in the
depth of her heart, never did there lurk a bitter feeling.
She was fourteen and a half when she married. At that
time her mind was violently agitated by religious doubts.
Notwithstanding the very tender feeling which drew her
towards my father, she was much troubled by the thought
of the solemn engagement she was taking at so early an
age. All she felt appeared to her beyond her strength,
and she placed herself under the protection of God, to
whom in the midst of her disquietudes she never ceased
to look for support.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s grief at my father’s departure to join
his regiment made her feel how deeply she was attached
to him. She did not leave her paternal home. In consequence
of the extreme youth of both my parents, for
my father was but sixteen years of age, it had been
agreed that they should pass several years at the Hôtel
de Noailles, the town residence of my mother’s family.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The following winter was very gay. My mother as
well as her sister frequently went both to the play and
to balls. She enjoyed all these pleasures with the liveliness
of her age and disposition. Nevertheless, I do not
think she ever allowed herself to join in any before it
had been proved to her that she was conscientiously
obliged to partake in them. Never, even in her earliest
youth, did she allow herself to taste a single worldly
amusement without being actuated by motives of duty
superior to those which forbade them. She did not join
in them without reflection, but, once decided, she would
enjoy herself thoroughly and without scruple. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>worthy of remark that the religious doubts which tortured
her should not have made her less timorous on
this point. On the contrary, she was incessantly applying
for the grace of God in order to learn the fulness of
truth. He granted her prayers; her mind ceased to be
troubled. She made her first communion that same year,
on the first Sunday after Easter, and gave herself up to
God, in whom she continued to trust so faithfully amidst
all the vicissitudes of life. Shortly afterwards, her first
child, little Henriette, was born.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before La Fayette’s wound, received at Brandywine,
was sufficiently healed to permit him to wear a boot, he
was so impatient to enter into active service, that he
offered himself again as a volunteer, and joined an expedition
which was then fitting out under General Greene,
to operate in New Jersey. Preparations were made to
give battle to Lord Cornwallis; but that officer having
received large re-enforcements, General Greene, though
greatly disappointed, deemed it inexpedient to dare an
attack. But young La Fayette could not consent to retire
without attempting to strike a blow. He was accordingly
placed at the head of a small company, for
reconnoitring, and authorized to make an attack if he
thought it advisable. While he was examining the
enemy’s position, his little band came suddenly upon a
picket of four hundred Hessians. La Fayette’s company
numbered only three hundred men; but he led them gallantly
to the attack, and the Hessians were soon flying
before them. La Fayette followed, and the Hessians
meeting re-enforcements, turned to meet their brave pursuers.
Great as the odds were against him, La Fayette
and his valiant band boldly met the enemy, and again
put them to flight, pursuing them until dark; they returned
to camp with only five men wounded and one
dead. Such was the battle of Gloucester.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>This heroic action so impressed Congress with the
bravery of La Fayette, that they promptly responded
to Washington’s renewed request in behalf of the young
marquis; and on the 1st of December, 1777, the following
resolution was passed:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That General Washington be informed it is highly
agreeable to Congress that the Marquis de La Fayette be appointed
to the command of a division in the continental army.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Three days after, La Fayette was publicly invested
with his rank, and placed over the division of Virginia
troops, lately lead by General Stephens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The campaign of 1777 was now drawing to its close.
Sir William Howe, having recalled Lord Cornwallis, endeavored
to force Washington from his position; but
though there were several skirmishes, in which La
Fayette distinguished himself, Washington would not
be decoyed by his crafty foe, and Howe marched back
to Philadelphia without having effected a battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Revolutionary army now went into winter quarters
at Valley Forge. La Fayette thus describes the
condition of their troops at this time:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The unfortunate soldiers were in want of everything;
they had neither coats, hats, shirts, nor shoes; their feet
and legs froze until they became black, and it was often
necessary to amputate them. From want of money they
could not obtain either provisions or any means of transport.
The colonels were often reduced to two rations,
and sometimes to one. The army frequently remained
whole days without provisions, and the patient endurance
of both soldiers and officers was a miracle, which
each moment served to renew. But the sight of their
misery prevented new engagements; it was almost impossible
to levy recruits; it was easy to desert into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>interior of the country. The sacred fires of liberty were
not extinguished, it is true, and the majority of the
citizens detested British tyranny, but the triumph of
the North (Gates’ defeat of Burgoyne) and the tranquillity
of the South had lulled to sleep two-thirds of
the continent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette endured with uncomplaining patience the
greatest privations. He adopted the American dress,
habits, and food. He allowed himself to fare no better
than his comrades in war; and though his entire life
heretofore had been spent in ease and luxury, he repined
not at cold and scanty provisions, but rather gloried in
his personal sacrifices. He thus writes from Valley
Forge to his father-in-law, the Duke d’Ayen, in France:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The loss of Philadelphia is far from being so important
as it is conceived to be in Europe. If the difference
of circumstances, of countries, and of proportions between
the two armies were not duly considered, the
success of General Gates would appear surprising when
compared with the events which have occurred with us,
taking into account the superiority of General Washington
over General Gates. Our general is a man formed,
in truth, for this revolution, which could not have been
accomplished without him. I see him more intimately
than any other man, and I see that he is worthy of the
adoration of his country. His tender friendship for me
and his complete confidence in me relating to all political
and military subjects, great as well as small, enable
me to judge of all the interests he has to conciliate, and
all the difficulties he has to conquer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I admire each day more fully the excellence of his
character and the kindness of his heart. Some foreigners
are displeased at not having been employed, although it
did not depend on him to employ them; others, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ambitious projects he would not serve, and some intriguing
jealous men, have endeavored to injure his reputation;
but his name will be revered in every age by all
true lovers of liberty and humanity. Although I may
appear to be eulogizing my friend, I believe that the
part he makes me act gives me the right of avowing
publicly how much I admire and respect him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“America is most impatiently expecting us to declare
for her, and France will one day, I trust, determine to humble
the pride of England. This thought, and the measures
which America appears determined to pursue, give
me great hopes for the glorious establishment of her
independence. We are not, I confess, as strong as I
expected; but we are strong enough to fight, and we
shall do so, I think, with some degree of success. With
the assistance of France we shall gain the cause that
I cherish, because it is the cause of justice; because
it honors humanity; because it is important to my
country; and because my American friends and myself
are deeply engaged in it. The approaching campaign
will be an interesting one. It is said that the English
are sending against us some Hanoverians; some time
ago they threatened us with what was far worse,—the
arrival of some Russians. A slight menace from France
would lessen the number of these re-enforcements. The
more I see of the English, the more thoroughly convinced
I am that it is necessary to speak to them in a loud tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After having wearied you with public affairs, you
must not expect to escape without being wearied also
with my private affairs. It is impossible to be more
agreeably situated in a foreign country than I am. I
have only feelings of pleasure to express, and I have
each day more reason to be satisfied with the conduct of
Congress towards me, although my military occupations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>have allowed me to become personally acquainted with
but few of its members. Those I do know have especially
loaded me with marks of kindness and attention.
The new president, Mr. Laurens, one of the most respectable
men of America, is my particular friend. As to the
army, I have had the happiness of obtaining the friendship
of every individual; not one opportunity is lost of
giving me proofs of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I passed the whole summer without receiving a
division, which you know had been my previous intention;
I passed all that time at General Washington’s
house, where I felt as if I were with a friend of twenty
years’ standing. Since my return from Jersey, he has
desired me to choose among several brigades the division
which may please me best. I have chosen one entirely
composed of Virginians. It is weak in point of numbers
at present, just in proportion, however, to the weakness
of the whole army, and almost in a state of nakedness;
but I am promised cloth, of which I shall make clothes,
and recruits, of which soldiers must be made, about the
same period; but unfortunately the latter is the more
difficult task, even for more skilful men than I.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The task I am performing here, if I have acquired
sufficient experience to perform it well, will improve
exceedingly my future knowledge. The major-general
replaces the lieutenant-general and the field-marshal in
their most important functions, and I should have the
power of employing to advantage both my talents and
experience, if Providence and my extreme youth allowed
me to boast of possessing either. I read, I study, I examine,
I listen, I reflect; and the result of all is the
endeavor to form an opinion into which I infuse as
much common sense as possible. I will not talk much
for fear of saying foolish things; I will still less risk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>acting much, for fear of doing foolish things; for I am
not disposed to abuse the confidence which the Americans
have so kindly placed in me. Such is the plan of
conduct which I have followed until now, and which I
shall continue to follow; but when some plans occur to
me which I believe may become useful when properly
rectified, I hasten to impart them to a great judge, who
is good enough to say he is pleased with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the other hand, when my heart tells me that a
favorable opportunity offers, I cannot refuse myself the
pleasure of participating in the peril; but I do not think
that the vanity of success ought to make us risk the
safety of an army, or of any portion of it, which may
not be formed or calculated for the offensive. If I
could make an axiom with the certainty of not saying
a foolish thing, I should venture to add that whatever
may be our force, we must content ourselves with a
completely defensive plan, with the exception, however,
of the moment when we may be forced to action, because
I think I have perceived that the English troops are
more astonished by a brisk attack than by a firm resistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This letter will be given you by the celebrated
Adams, whose name must undoubtedly be known to
you. As I have never allowed myself to quit the army,
I have never seen him. He wished that I should give
him letters of introduction to France, especially to yourself.
May I hope that you will have the goodness to
receive him kindly, and even to give him some information
respecting the present state of affairs? I fancied
that you would not be sorry to converse with a man
whose merit is so universally acknowledged. He desires
ardently to succeed in obtaining the esteem of our nation.
One of his friends himself told me this.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>About this time a base and treacherous intrigue was
formed against Washington. General Gates’ victory
over Burgoyne covered his name with a blaze of glory,
and censurers of Washington’s prudent policies were
not slow in suggesting that Horatio Gates was entitled
to the honor of receiving the post of commander-in-chief;
and there were not wanting ambitious partisans
and disloyal spirits to swell the ranks of the plotting
discontents. Treachery and falsehood now joined their
crafty hands in fellowship, and together working their
machinations, they strove by base insinuations to break
down the influence of Washington, and even endeavored
to enlist the true-hearted La Fayette in favor of
their vile schemes. But the friendship of the young
marquis could not be weakened by any artful plot, nor
could his firm alliance be shaken by any promises of
rank or power.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at this time that he sent to Washington this
manly and appreciative letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear General</span>: I went yesterday morning to
headquarters, with an intention of speaking to your
excellency, but you were too busy, and I shall inform
you in this letter what I wished to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t need to tell you that I am sorry for all that has
happened for some time past. My sorrow is a necessary
consequence of my most tender and respectful friendship
for you, which affection is as true and candid as the
other sentiments of my heart, and much stronger than
so new an acquaintance seems to admit; but another
reason to be concerned in the present circumstances is
the result of my ardent and perhaps enthusiastic wishes
for the happiness and liberty of this country. I see
plainly that America can defend herself if proper measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>are taken, and now I begin to fear lest she should
be lost by herself and her own sons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I was in Europe, I thought that here almost
every man was a lover of liberty, and would rather die
free than live a slave. You can conceive of my astonishment
when I saw that Toryism was as openly professed
as Whiggism itself; however, at that time I
believed that all good Americans were united together;
that the confidence of Congress in you was unbounded.
Then I entertained the belief that America would be
independent in case she should not lose you. Take
away for an instant that modest diffidence of yourself
(which, pardon my freedom, my dear General, is sometimes
too great, and I wish you could know as well as
myself what difference there is between you and every
other man), you would see very plainly that, if you were
lost for America, there is nobody who could hold the
army and the revolution six months. There are open
discussions in Congress; parties who hate one another
as much as the common enemy; stupid men, who, without
knowing a single word about war, undertake to
judge you, to make ridiculous comparisons. They are
infatuated with Gates, without thinking of the different
circumstances, and believe that attacking is the
only thing necessary to conquer. These ideas are entertained
by some jealous men, and perhaps secret
friends to the British government, who want to push
you, in a moment of ill-humor, to some rash enterprise
upon the lines, and against a much stronger army. I
should not take the liberty of mentioning these particulars
if I had not received a letter about this matter from
a young, good-natured gentleman at York, whom Conway
has ruined by his cunning, but who entertains the greatest
respect for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>La Fayette then recounts the efforts which the enemies
of Washington had made to win his allegiance from
the commander-in-chief, and closes by reiterating his
tender and profound respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Washington, in replying to this letter, thanks La
Fayette for the “fresh proof of friendship and attachment
which it gave him,” and in conclusion writes:
“But we must not, in so great a contest, expect to meet
nothing but sunshine. I have no doubt that everything
happens for the best, that we shall triumph over all our
misfortunes, and, in the end, be happy,—when, my dear
Marquis, if you will give me your company in Virginia,
we will laugh at our past difficulties and the folly of
others, and I will endeavor, by every civility in my
power, to show you how much, and how sincerely, I am
your affectionate and obedient servant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A new board of war had been instituted by Congress,
designed to have a general control of military affairs.
Of this board Gates was made president, and his influence
was given in favor of measures contrary to the
views of Washington. As La Fayette could neither be
persuaded nor bribed to be false to Washington, the conspirators
conceived a new plan. An expedition into
Canada was proposed, and Congress went so far as to
make a resolution regarding said expedition, and give all
control of the same into the hands of the Board of War.
This was the opportunity wished for by Washington’s
enemies. Without consulting Washington, La Fayette
was informed that he was appointed to the command of
this expedition, and ordered to report at Albany, where
the troops were to rendezvous. The instructions given
him were of the vaguest kind, and, as after-events proved,
intended to mislead him. Washington having advised
La Fayette to accept the commission, the marquis departed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>taking with him his countryman, the Baron de
Kalb, as second in command. As authority for these
statements, we would refer to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Mémoires et Manuscrits”</span>
of La Fayette, published by his family in Paris,
in 1837, in which La Fayette himself declares these
facts, and where the following letter appears. A note
is also added by his son, which says: “He wrote to
Congress that he could not accept the command only
upon the condition that he should remain subordinate
to General Washington, and should be considered as an
officer despatched by him, to whom he should address
his letters, of which those received at the bureau of war
should be but duplicates. These demands, and all others
which he had made, were granted.” The result of this
expedition may be learned by the accompanying letter
from La Fayette to Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>In previous letters, which we will not quote, the marquis
entered into minute details regarding the entire
expedition, from the time of his departure until his
arrival at Albany, enumerating the many strange and
suspicious circumstances which came to his knowledge.
He then sums up the situation in the following
letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: I have an opportunity of writing
to your Excellency, which I will not miss by any means,
even should I be afraid of becoming tedious and troublesome;
but if they have sent me far from you, I don’t
know for what purpose, at least I must make some little
use of my pen, to prevent all communication from being
cut off between your Excellency and myself. I have
written lately to you my distressing, ridiculous, foolish,
and indeed nameless situation. I am sent with great
noise, at the head of an army, for doing great things; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>whole continent, France and Europe herself, and what is
the worst, the British army, are in great expectations.
How far they will be deceived, how far we shall be ridiculed,
you may judge by the candid account you have got
of the state of affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are things, I dare say, in which I am deceived;
a certain colonel is not here for nothing; one other gentleman
became very popular before I came to this place:
Arnold himself is very fond of him. Every side on which
I turn to look I am sure a cloud is drawn before my eyes;
but there are points I cannot be deceived upon. The
want of money, the dissatisfaction among the soldiers,
the disinclination of every one (except the Canadians,
who thereby would stay at home) for this expedition, are
as conspicuous as possible. I am sure I shall become very
ridiculous and be laughed at. <em>My expedition</em> will be as
famous as the <em>secret expedition</em> against Rhode Island. I
confess, my dear General, that I find myself of very sensitive
feelings whenever my reputation and glory are concerned
in anything. It is very hard indeed that such a
part of my happiness, without which I cannot live, should
depend upon schemes which I never knew of but when
there was no time to put them into execution. I assure
you, my most dear and respected friend, that I am more
unhappy than I ever was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My desire for doing something was such that I have
thought of doing it by surprise, with a detachment, but
this seems to me rash and quite impossible. I should be
very happy if you were here to give me some advice, but
I have nobody to consult with. They have sent to me
more than twenty French officers, but I do not know
what to do with them. I beg you will acquaint me with
the line of conduct you advise me to follow on every
point. I am at a loss how to act, and indeed I do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>know what I am here for myself. However, as being the
highest officer (after General Arnold) who has desired me
to take the command, I think it is my duty to guard the
affairs of this part of America as well as I can. Though
General Gates holds the title and power of commander-in-chief
of the Northern Department, as two hundred thousand
dollars have arrived, I have taken upon myself to pay
the most important of the debts we are involved in. I
am about sending provisions to Fort Schuyler; and will go
and see the fort. I will try to get some clothes for the
troops, and buy some articles for the next campaign. I
have directed some money to be borrowed upon my credit
to satisfy the soldiers, who are much discontented. In
all I endeavor to do for the best, though I have no
particular authority or instructions. I will come as near
as I can to General Gates’ intentions, but I anxiously
desire to get an answer to my letters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fancy (between us) that the actual scheme is to
have me out of this part of the continent, and General
Conway in chief command under the immediate direction
of General Gates. How they will bring it about I do
not know, but you may be sure something of that kind
will appear. You are nearer than myself, and every
honest man in Congress is your friend; therefore you
can foresee and prevent, if possible, the evil, a hundred
times better than I can. I would only give the idea to
your Excellency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you be so good as to present my respects to
your lady? With the most tender affection and highest
respect I have the honor to be, etc.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Deeply sympathizing with the trying position of the
high-spirited young marquis, Washington used his influence
to have him recalled; but in such manner as should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>honor his fidelity and exonerate his name from any blame.
His kind efforts in behalf of La Fayette were successful,
and on the second of March the Board of War was
directed “to instruct the Marquis de La Fayette to suspend
for the present the intended invasion, and at the
same time inform him that Congress entertained a high
sense of his prudence, activity, and zeal; and that they
were fully persuaded nothing has or would have been
wanting on his part, or on the part of the officers who
accompanied him, to give the expedition the utmost
possible effect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette accordingly returned to Valley Forge, and
rejoined Washington. How inexpressibly comforting to
the harassed heart of Washington must have been the
faithfulness of this young knight, who laid his sword
and fortune at the feet of his adopted father, before
whose character and virtue he bowed with devotion and
stanch loyalty.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 19th of May, 1778, Sir William Howe, then
commanding the British troops occupying Philadelphia,
planned to give the fair Tory ladies a delightful surprise.
Valley Forge was about twenty miles from Philadelphia,
and already Washington had begun several man&oelig;uvres
in the opening campaign. La Fayette had been detached
with a picked company of two thousand men, and ordered
to cross the Schuylkill, and take up his post as an advance
guard of the army. In accordance with these
instructions, the marquis had stationed himself at Barren
Hill, about midway between Valley Forge and Philadelphia.
This interesting piece of news soon reached
Sir William Howe, and he thereupon determined to entrap
the marquis, and exhibit him at a banquet which he
had ordered to be prepared, and to which he had invited
his lady friends, promising that they should upon that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>occasion behold the captured marquis, whose fame, fortune,
youth, and chivalry had long engaged their attention
and excited their deepest curiosity, and caused them
eagerly to desire a sight of this young nobleman.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Sir William Howe and his fair Tory friends reckoned
without their host. Though the marquis was
scarcely twenty-one, he was not so easily outwitted by
even such a military tactician as the renowned British
commander. He also heard of this fine plan to entrap
him, and determined by a hazardous and brilliant man&oelig;uvre
to elude his foe. There was but one method
practicable, but it required great daring and cunning.
La Fayette was convinced that he must recross the
river. To attempt this seemed destruction; but his
inventive wit and quick planning came to his rescue.
He would feign an attack, himself lead a portion of his
band boldly against the British general, who had been
stationed by Howe to guard the ford. This he did,
meanwhile ordering the remainder of his men to cross
the river under cover of this stratagem. The plan was
entirely successful. The British, imagining that La
Fayette’s whole division was coming against them, halted
and prepared for battle. This delay was La Fayette’s
opportunity; perceiving that part of his troops had
crossed the river, according to directions, he slowly
withdrew his own forces, and ere his enemies were aware,
his entire band had arrived on the other side of the river;
and when the British reached Barren Hill, La Fayette’s
late camp, their intended prey had escaped and were
marching towards Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Finding the bird flown, the English returned to Philadelphia,
spent with fatigue and ashamed of having done
nothing. The ladies did not see M. de La Fayette, and
General Howe himself arrived too late for supper.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>General Washington had watched through a glass the
imminent peril which threatened the marquis; and when
he clasped him in his arms, his heart was stirred, and
his eyes glistened with deep feeling. Loud acclamations
saluted the gallant band of soldiers, and their
young leader became only second in their hearts to Washington.
From that moment the influence of La Fayette
was unlimited. His youth made his exploit all the more
remarkable, and his courage won their profoundest admiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Chastellux, in his work entitled “Journey from
Newport to Philadelphia,” thus wrote of La Fayette’s
influence in the army: “We availed ourselves of the
cessation of the rain to accompany his Excellency [General
Washington] to the camp of the marquis [General
La Fayette]. We found all his troops ranged in line of
battle on the heights to the left, and himself at their
head, expressing both by his deportment and physiognomy
that he preferred seeing me there to receiving me
at his estate in Auvergne. The confidence and attachment
of his troops are most precious in his eyes; for he
looks upon that species of wealth as one of which he
cannot be deprived. But what I find still more flattering
to a young man of his age, is the influence which he
has acquired in political as well as in military circles.
I have no fear of being contradicted when I assert that
mere letters from him have often had more influence in
some of the states of the Union than the strongest invitations
on the part of the Congress. On seeing him it
is difficult to determine which is the more surprising
circumstance, that a young man should have already
given so many proofs of talent, or that a man so proved
should still leave so much room for hope. Happy will
his country be if she knows how to avail herself of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>aid; and happier still, should that aid become superfluous
to her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But just as the welcome words of commendation from
his beloved chief fell upon the ear of La Fayette, sad
tidings were wafted to him from over the sea. The
darling little Henriette, who had not yet learned to lisp
her father’s name when he parted with her, but since
then had tried with baby prattle to tell her love for her
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cher papa</em></span>, had been stricken down; the infant tongue
had been silenced, the wondering eyes closed, and the
devoted father must wait until he too passed beyond
life’s river, to be recognized by his much-loved Henriette.</p>

<p class='c010'>With sorrowful heart he pens these touching lines to
his idolized wife:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a dreadful thing is absence! I never experienced
before all the horrors of separation. My own
deep sorrow is aggravated by the feeling that I am not
able to share and sympathize in your anguish. The
length of time that elapsed before I heard of this
event also increased my misery. Consider, my love,
what a dreadful thing it must be to weep for what I have
lost, and tremble for what remains. The distance between
Europe and America appears to me more enormous
than ever. The loss of our poor child is almost constantly
in my thoughts. This sad news followed almost immediately
that of the treaty; and while my heart was torn
by grief, I was obliged to receive and take part in expressions
of public joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the unfortunate news had reached me sooner, I
should have set out immediately to rejoin you; but the
account of the treaty, which we received the first of
May, prevented me from leaving this country. The
opening campaign does not allow me to retire. I have
always been perfectly convinced that by serving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>cause of humanity and that of America I serve also the
interests of France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Embrace a million times our little Anastasie; alas!
she is all that we have left. I feel that my divided
tenderness is now concentrated upon her. Take the best
care of her. Adieu!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>ON Sunday, the 28th of June, 1778, the battle of
Monmouth was fought. General Lee, who commanded
the troops first in action, with seeming treachery
ordered a retreat; and though La Fayette endeavored to
stem the tide of defeat, a total rout seemed certain, when
Washington rode upon the field, and seeing his orders
had been disobeyed, he accosted Lee with cutting severity,
and gave instant commands to turn about. “<em>Long
live Washington!</em>” rang the shout along the ranks, and
the white charger, bearing the chieftain, was looked upon
as a herald of victory. The irresistible genius of that
quiet man turned back the tide of war, and forced the
British to retreat, and night alone prevented the Americans
from pushing on to a further attack. Everywhere
had La Fayette been seen encouraging his men. Where
the greatest danger was, there was always his place.
With the utmost coolness he gave orders or obeyed the
directions of his chief. Colonel Willet, who had volunteered
as an aide to General Scott, who commanded the
infantry, says that in the hottest of the fight he saw La
Fayette ride up, and in a voice cool, steady, and slow,
and with as much deliberation as if nothing exciting prevailed,
said: “General, the enemy is making an attempt
to cut off our right wing—march to its assistance with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>all your force.” So saying, he galloped off, being exceedingly
well mounted, though plainly dressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>An officer under the immediate command of La Fayette
said of him at this battle: “I have been charmed
with the blooming gallantry and sagacity of the Marquis
de La Fayette, who appears to be possessed of every
requisite to constitute a great general.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the “Historical Anecdotes of the Reign of Louis
XVI.,” an incident of this battle is related as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the American war a general officer in the service
of the United States advanced with a score of men,
under the English batteries, to reconnoitre their position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His aide-de-camp, struck by a ball, fell at his side, while
the officers and orderly dragoons fled precipitately. The
general, though under the fire of the cannon, approached
the wounded man to see whether he had any signs of
life remaining, or whether any assistance could be afforded
him. Finding the wound had been mortal, he turned his
eyes away with emotion, and slowly rejoined the group
which had gotten out of the reach of the pieces. This
instance of courage and humanity took place at the battle
of Monmouth. General Clinton, who commanded the
English troops, knew that the Marquis de La Fayette
usually rode a white horse; and it was upon a white
horse that the general officer who retired so slowly was
mounted. Sir Henry Clinton, therefore, commanded the
gunners not to fire. This noble forbearance probably
saved General La Fayette’s life. At that time he was
but twenty-two years of age.”</p>

<p class='c010'>During the summer of 1778 an expedition against
Newport, then held by the British, was planned. A
French fleet under Count d’Estaing had arrived. The
plan was to move against Newport by land and sea.
When all was arranged, the Count d’Estaing for some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>reason changed his purpose, and the expedition was necessarily
abandoned. In the negotiations La Fayette displayed
much zeal, and hearing that the American army
was flying before the enemy, he immediately started for
the scene, and by his intrepid courage turned the tide of
pursuit, and brought back the troops without the loss of
a man. This brave conduct of La Fayette met with universal
commendation, and in his honor Congress passed
the following resolution:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That Mr. President be requested to inform the
Marquis de La Fayette that Congress have a due sense of the
sacrifice he made of his personal feelings in undertaking a journey
to Boston, with a view of promoting the interests of these
states, at a time when an occasion was daily expected of his
acquiring glory in the field, and that his gallantry in going on
to Rhode Island, when the greatest part of the army had retreated,
and his good conduct in bringing off the pickets and
out-sentinels, deserve their particular approbation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Laurens, who was then President of Congress,
accompanied this resolution with the following letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, Sept. 13, 1778.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I experience a high degree of satisfaction in
fulfilling the instructions embraced in the enclosed act
of Congress of the ninth instant, which expresses the
sentiments of the representatives of the United States of
America, relative to your excellent conduct during the
expedition recently undertaken against Rhode Island.
Receive, Sir, this testimonial on the part of Congress as
a tribute of the respect and gratitude offered to you by
a free people.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have the honor to be with very great respect and
esteem, Sir, your obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Henry Laurens</span>, President.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>To these communications La Fayette replied:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Camp</span>, Sept. 23, 1778.</div>

<p class='c010'>“Sir: I have just received the letter of the 13th
instant with which you have favored me, and in which
you communicate the honor which Congress has been
pleased to confer by the adoption of its flattering resolution.
Whatever sentiments of pride may be reasonably
excited by such marks of approbation, I am not the less
sensible of the feelings of gratitude, nor of the satisfaction
of believing that my efforts have, in some measure,
been considered as useful to a cause in which my heart
is so deeply interested. Have the goodness, Sir, to present
to Congress my unfeigned and humble thanks,
springing from the bottom of my heart, and accompanied
with the assurances of my sincere and perfect attachment,
as the only homage worthy of being offered to the
representatives of a free people.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the moment that I first heard the name of
America, I loved her; from the moment that I learned
her struggles for liberty, I was inflamed with the desire
of shedding my blood in her cause; and the moments
that may be expended in her service, whenever they may
occur, or in whatever part of the world I may be, shall
be considered as the happiest of my existence. I feel
more ardently than ever the desire of deserving the obliging
sentiments with which I am honored by the United
States and by their representatives, and the flattering
confidence which they have been pleased to repose in me
has filled my heart with the liveliest gratitude and most
lasting affection.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s youthful enthusiasm and his love of his
country were both so intense that his first impulse was
to resent any national slight as a personal affront.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>La Fayette wanted to send a challenge, in 1778, to
Lord Carlisle, an English commissioner, who, in a letter
to the American Congress, had in his opinion used a
phrase insulting to France. Washington at once wrote
to him disapproving the challenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The generous spirit of chivalry,” he said, “when
banished from the rest of the world has taken refuge,
my dear friend, in the highly wrought feelings of your
nation. But you cannot do anything if the other party
will not second you; and though these feelings may have
been suitable to the times to which they belonged, it is
to be feared that in our day your adversary, taking shelter
behind modern opinions and his public character,
may even slightly ridicule so old-fashioned a virtue. Besides,
even supposing his lordship should accept your
challenge, experience has proved that chance, far more
than bravery or justice, decides in such affairs. I therefore
should be very unwilling to risk, on this occasion, a
life which ought to be reserved for greater things. I
trust that his Excellency, Admiral the Count d’Estaing,
will agree with me in this opinion, and that so soon as
he can part with you, he will send you to headquarters,
where I shall be truly glad to welcome you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The English commissioner, as Washington had anticipated,
declined the challenge upon public grounds, adding:
“In my opinion such national disputes may be best
settled by the fleets under Admiral Byron and the Count
d’Estaing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time La Fayette wrote from his camp to
Washington, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me joy, my dear General: I intend to have
your picture. Mr. Hancock has promised me a copy
of the one he has in Boston. He gave one to Count
d’Estaing, and I never saw a man so glad at possessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>his sweetheart’s picture as the admiral was to receive
yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To these fond words Washington thus replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sentiments of affection and attachment which
breathe so conspicuously in all your letters to me are at
once pleasing and honorable, and afford me abundant
cause to rejoice at the happiness of my acquaintance
with you. Your love of liberty, the just sense you
entertain of this valuable blessing, and your noble and
disinterested exertions in the cause of it, added to the
innate goodness of your heart, conspire to render you
dear to me; and I think myself happy in being linked
with you in bonds of the strictest friendship.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The ardent zeal which you have displayed during the
whole course of the campaign to the eastward, and your
endeavors to cherish harmony among the officers of the
allied powers, and to dispel those unfavorable impressions
which had begun to take place in the minds of the unthinking,
from misfortunes which the utmost stretch of
human foresight could not avert, deserved, and now
receive, my particular and warmest thanks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Could I have conceived that my picture had been an
object of your wishes, or in the smallest degree worthy
of your attention, I should, while Mr. Peale was in camp
at Valley Forge, have got him to take the best portrait
of me he could, and presented it to you; but I really
had not so good an opinion of my own worth as to suppose
that such a compliment would not have been considered
as a greater instance of my vanity, than means
of your gratification; and therefore, when you requested
me to sit to Monsieur Lanfang, I thought it was only to
obtain the outlines and a few shades of my features, to
have some prints struck from.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Reports now reached La Fayette that the French ministry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>were planning an attack upon England; whereupon
he wrote to the Duke d’Ayen:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should consider myself as almost dishonored if I were
not present at such a moment. I should feel so much
regret and shame, that I should be tempted to drown or
hang myself, according to the English mode. My greatest
happiness would be to drive them from this country, and
then to repair to England, serving under your command.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Feeling that his presence was now required in France,
and that he could there best serve America, La Fayette
solicited from Congress a leave of absence, that he might
return to his own country. General Washington sent
the following letter to the President of Congress by
La Fayette:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters</span>, Oct. 6, 1778.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: This letter will be presented to you by Major-General
La Fayette. The generous motives which formerly
induced him to cross the ocean, and serve in the
armies of the United States are known to Congress.
The same praiseworthy reasons now urge him to return
to his native country, which under the existing circumstances
has a claim to his services.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However anxious he was to fulfil the duty which he
owes to his king and country, that powerful consideration
could not induce him to leave this continent while the fate
of the campaign remains undecided. He is, therefore, determined
to remain until the termination of the present
campaign, and takes advantage of the present cessation
from hostilities to communicate his designs to Congress,
so that the necessary arrangements may be made at a
convenient season, while he is at hand, if occasion should
offer, to distinguish himself in the army.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the same time, the marquis, being desirous of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>preserving his connection with this country, and hoping
that he may enjoy opportunities of being useful to it as
an American officer, only solicits leave of absence, for the
purpose of embracing the views which have been already
suggested. The pain which it costs me to separate from
an officer who possesses all the military fire of youth,
with a rare maturity of judgment, would lead me, if the
choice depended on my wishes, to place his absence on
the footing which he proposes. I shall always esteem it
a pleasure to be able to give those testimonials of his
service to which they are entitled, from the bravery and
conduct which have distinguished him on every occasion;
and I do not doubt that Congress will, in a proper manner,
express how sensibly they appreciate his merits and
how much they regret his departure. I have the honor
to be, etc.,</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>George Washington</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette proceeded to Philadelphia, bearing this
letter from Washington. Having arrived there, he at
once addressed the following letter to the President of
Congress:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, Oct. 13, 1778.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: However attentive I ought to be not to employ
the precious moments of Congress in the consideration of
private affairs, I beg leave, with that confidence which
naturally springs from affection and gratitude, to unfold
to them the circumstances in which I am at present situated.
It is impossible to speak more appropriately of the
sentiments which attach me to my own country than in
the presence of citizens who have done so much for their
own. So long as I have had the power of regulating my
own actions, it has been my pride and pleasure to fight
beneath the banners of America in the defence of a cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>which I may dare more particularly to call <em>ours</em>, as I
have shed my blood in its support.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Sir, that France is engaged in war, I am urged,
both by duty and patriotism, to present myself before
my sovereign, to know in what manner he may be
pleased to employ my services. The most pleasing service
that I can render will be that which enables me to
serve the common cause among those whose friendships
I have had the happiness to obtain, and in whose fortunes
I participated when your prospects were less
bright than they now are. This motive, together with
others which Congress will appreciate, induce me to
request permission to return to my own country in the
ensuing winter. So long as a hope remained of an active
campaign, I never indulged the idea of leaving the army,
but the present state of peace and inaction leads me to
prefer to Congress this petition. If it should be pleased
to grant my request, the arrangements for my departure
shall be taken in such a manner that the result of the
campaign shall be known before they are put into execution.
I enclose a letter from his Excellency, General
Washington, consenting to the leave of absence which I
wish to obtain. I flatter myself that you will consider
me as a soldier on leave of absence, ardently wishing to
rejoin his colors as well as his beloved comrades. If,
when I return to the midst of my fellow-citizens, it is
believed that I can, in any manner, promote the prosperity
of America, if my most strenuous exertions can
promise any useful results, I trust, Sir, that I shall
always be considered as the man who has the prosperity
of the United States most at heart, and who
entertains for their representatives the most perfect love
and esteem. I have the honor to be, etc.,</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Congress readily granted this request, and after directing
that a letter should be written to La Fayette thanking
him for his disinterested zeal and the services which
he had rendered to the United States, Congress passed
the resolution that: “The Minister Plenipotentiary of
the United States of America at the court of Versailles
be directed to cause an elegant sword, with proper devices,
to be made and presented in the name of the
United States to the Marquis de La Fayette.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While La Fayette was making his preparations to
return to France, he was stricken down by a violent
fever which for a time threatened to be fatal. The
entire army displayed the most intense interest regarding
his state, and great was the joy when the physicians
at length announced that the marquis would recover.
General Washington visited him daily at Fishkill, where
he was taken sick, and paid him every kind and tender
attention in his power. During La Fayette’s convalescence
a gentleman visited him, who thus describes
his appearance at that time:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the request of Colonel Gibson I waited on the
Marquis de La Fayette. The Colonel furnished me with
a letter of introduction, and his compliments, with inquiries
respecting the Marquis’ health. I was received
by this nobleman in a polite and affable manner. He
is just recovering from a fever, and is in his chair of
convalescence. He is nearly six feet high, large, but
not corpulent, being not more than twenty-two years of
age. He is not very elegant in his form, his shoulders
being broad and high, nor is there a perfect symmetry in
his features; his forehead is remarkably high, his nose
large and long, eyebrows prominent and projecting over
a fine animated hazel eye. His countenance is interesting
and impressive. He converses in broken English,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and displays the manners and address of an accomplished
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A vessel called the <em>Alliance</em> had been furnished La
Fayette for his voyage to France. On January 11,
1779, he penned these farewell lines to Washington,
written on board the <em>Alliance</em>:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“Farewell, my dear General. I hope your French
friend will ever be dear to you. I hope I shall soon see
you again, and tell you myself with what emotion I now
leave the coast you inhabit, and with what affection and
respect I am forever, my dear General, your respectful
and sincere friend,</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>La Fayette</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>But notwithstanding the face of the young marquis
was thus set homeward, it was not all smooth sailing.
Terrible storms tossed the little vessel to and fro, and
for a time it seemed as though the huge waves would
engulf the frigate. The main top-mast was blown away,
the vessel rolled upon the heavy swells, apparently at the
mercy of the tempest, while the dashing billows broke
over the dismantled craft, which was soon half filled
with water, and seemed doomed to destruction.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the darkness of the stormy night was followed
by the radiance of a calm and lovely morning. The
golden sunshine flooded the surface of the ocean, and
the <em>Alliance</em> sailed safely on her homeward way. But
storms were not the only dangers which beset the path
of La Fayette. A mutinous plot was formed among the
sailors, and only the promptness and energy of the
marquis, in ordering the arrest of thirty-one of the
mutineers, and placing them in irons, so awed the others
that tranquillity was secured.</p>

<p class='c010'>With what inexpressible eagerness La Fayette must
have turned to watch the first glimpse of his beloved land—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>land where dwelt his idolized wife and little babe
whose eyes had never yet rested on its father’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>His fame had gone before him, and his name was
known and spoken with pride and honor in every city
and hamlet of his native country. La Fayette landed
at Brest in February.</p>

<p class='c010'>His daughter thus describes her mother’s ecstasy at
this longed-for meeting:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The intensity of my mother’s joy was beyond all expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This happiness was soon disturbed by fresh alarms
which prevented her enjoying in peace my father’s return.
A projected invasion of England detained him a
long time on the coast. During his stay in France he
was continually employed in preparing fresh enterprises.
My mother’s health was shaken at once by past anxieties
and by the dread of future dangers. On the 24th of
December, 1779, my brother was born.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This brother of Virginie La Fayette was named George
Washington La Fayette, in honor of his father’s revered
friend. The expedition against England was, however,
abandoned; and La Fayette turned his attention to forwarding
the interests of America, by soliciting for her
army assistance in men, money, and clothing. So earnest
was his zeal that he offered to pledge his entire fortune
in the cause of the Republic. He wrote as follows
to President Laurens:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The affairs of America I shall ever look upon as my
first business while I am in Europe. Any confidence
from the king and ministers, any popularity I may have
among my own countrymen, any means in my power,
shall be, to the best of my skill, and to the end of my
life, exerted in behalf of an interest I have so much at
heart. If Congress believe that my influence may serve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>them in any way, I beg they will direct such orders to
me, that I may the more certainly and properly employ
the knowledge which I have of this court and country
for obtaining a success in which my heart is so much
interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The flattering affection with which Congress and the
American nation are pleased to honor me, makes me
very desirous of letting them know—if I dare speak
so frankly—how I enjoyed my private position. Happy
in the sight of my friends and family, after I was by
your attentive kindness safely brought again to my
native shore, I met with such an honorable reception,
and such kind sentiments as far exceeded any wishes I
could have conceived. I am indebted for that inexpressible
satisfaction which the good will of my countrymen
towards me affords to my heart, to their ardent love for
America, to the cause of freedom and its defenders, their
new allies, and to the idea which they entertain, that I
have had the happiness to serve the United States. To
these motives, Sir, and to the letter Congress was pleased
to write on my account, I owe the many favors the king
has conferred upon me. Without delay I was appointed
to the command of his own regiment of dragoons, and
everything he could have done, everything I could have
wished, I have received on account of your kind recommendations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sword which Congress had voted should be presented
to him was finished in August. It was of very
elegant workmanship. Among other elaborate designs
with which it was ornamented were representations of
the battle of Gloucester, the retreat of Barren Hill, the
battle of Monmouth, and the retreat of Rhode Island.
The sword was presented to the Marquis de La Fayette
by a grandson of Dr. Franklin, accompanied by a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>written by Benjamin Franklin, in which he said, “By
the help of the exquisite artists France affords, I find it
easy to express everything but the <em>sense we have of your
worth and our obligations to you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So enthusiastic were La Fayette’s efforts in behalf of
America, and such was his perseverance, that the prime
minister of France exclaimed in astonishment, “He would
unfurnish the palace of Versailles to clothe the American
army!” to which La Fayette, eagerly responded, “<em>I
would!</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>At length La Fayette received the welcome tidings
that the king and ministry had at last acceded to his
repeated requests; and he was instructed “to proceed
immediately to join General Washington, and to communicate
to him the secret that the king, willing to give
the United States a new proof of his affection and of
his interest in their security, is resolved to send to their
aid, at the opening of the spring, six vessels of the line
and six thousand regular troops of infantry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 19th of March, 1780, La Fayette sailed from
France to bear to America this joyful news; and at the
entrance of Boston harbor he wrote these words of greeting
to Washington, and despatched them by a messenger
to announce his arrival:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here I am, my dear General, and in the midst of
the joy I feel in finding myself again one of your loving
soldiers, I take but the time to tell you that I came
from France on board a frigate which the king gave me
for my passage. I have affairs of the utmost importance,
which I should at first communicate to you alone. In
case my letter finds you anywhere this side of Philadelphia,
I beg you will wait for me, and do assure you a
great public good may be derived from it. To-morrow
we go up to the town, and the day after I shall set off in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>my usual way to join my beloved and respected friend
and general.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When La Fayette landed in Boston he was received
with marked attention. The day was given up to public
rejoicing; bells were rung, cannon boomed, and the
shouts of the cheering multitude, mingled with the
strains of martial music, as America paid homage to her
adopted son. But these public honors, gratifying as
they were, could not detain the faithful young hero,
whose first desire was to clasp to his heart the form of
his adopted father and to look into the face of his beloved
general. Perhaps nowhere else in history is another
instance of such peculiar love and lasting friendship as
was displayed by La Fayette and Washington. The
young knight bowed at the feet of his chief, regarding
him as something almost more than mortal in the perfection
of his character and the attraction of his nature;
while the general, upon whose shoulders rested the responsibility
of a nation, felt his heart lightened and his
soul comforted by the sympathy and appreciation of this
self-sacrificing young marquis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Congress was not tardy now in rendering appropriate
thanks to the young marquis, and passed a resolution in
his honor. But Congress was not so ready to come to
the help of the suffering American army. Washington
again made an appeal in their behalf. “For the troops
to be without clothing at any time,” he wrote, “is highly
injurious to the service and distressing to our feelings;
but the want will be more peculiarly mortifying when
they come to act with those of our allies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette, as usual, started a relief fund from his
private purse, offering the ladies of Philadelphia, who
were making donations in aid of the suffering troops,
one hundred guineas in the name of Madame La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Amid innumerable discouragements Washington prepared
for the coming campaign. It was not until July
that the long-expected French fleet arrived, and then
only part of the promised assistance. Five thousand
five hundred men were sent, leaving two thousand, with
all the arms, munitions of war, and clothing promised
to La Fayette, to follow later. The intention of the
American army had been to unite with the French
allies in an attack upon New York. But the second
part of the French fleet was blockaded in the port of
Brest by a British squadron, thus disconcerting all the
plans of the allies. The immediate attack upon New
York was accordingly abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in September of this year, 1780, that the
treachery of Benedict Arnold was consummated. Washington
had, at the earnest solicitation of La Fayette,
left the camp to meet with Count de Rochambeau,
the leader of the French forces, and the Chevalier de
Ternay, the admiral of the French fleet. This important
interview had been arranged to take place at Hartford,
Conn. It was during the absence of Washington
that the traitor Arnold carried into execution his infamous
plot. La Fayette thus describes his discovery of
the nefarious deed, in a letter to the Chevalier de la
Luzerne:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I parted from you yesterday, Sir, to come and
breakfast here with General Arnold, we were far from
foreseeing the event which I am now going to relate to
you. You will shudder at the danger to which we were
exposed; you will admire the miraculous chain of unexpected
events and singular chances which have saved
us; but you will be still more astonished when you learn
by what instrument this conspiracy has been formed.
West Point was sold,—<em>and sold by Arnold</em>,—the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>man who formerly acquired glory by rendering such immense
services to his country. He had lately entered
in a horrible compact with the enemy and but for the
accident which brought us here at a certain hour, but
for the combination of chances that threw the adjutant-general
of the British army into the hands of some
peasants, beyond the limits of our stations, at West
Point and on the North River, they would both at present,
in all probability, be in the possession of the enemy.</p>

<div id='i098'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i-098.jpg' alt='Rochambeau' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>ROCHAMBEAU</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“When we set out yesterday for Fishkill, we were
preceded by one of my aides-de-camp and one of General
Washington’s [Colonels Hamilton and McHenry], who
found General Arnold and his wife at breakfast, and sat
down at the table with them. While they were together,
two letters were given to Arnold, which apprised him
of the arrest of the spy. He ordered a horse to be saddled,
went into his wife’s room to tell her he was ruined,
and desired his aide-de-camp to inform General Washington
that he was going to West Point, and would return
in the course of an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On our arrival here we crossed the river and went to
examine the works. You may conceive our astonishment
when we learned, on our return, that the arrested
spy was Major André, adjutant-general of the English
army; and when among his papers were discovered the
copy of an important council of war, the state of the garrison
and works, and observations upon various means of
attack and defence, the whole in Arnold’s own handwriting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The adjutant-general wrote also to the general
avowing his name and situation. Orders were sent to
arrest Arnold; but he escaped in a boat, got on board
the English frigate, the <em>Vulture</em>, and as no person suspected
his flight, he was not stopped at any post. Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Hamilton, who had gone in pursuit of him, received soon
after, by a flag of truce, a letter from Arnold to the general,
in which he entered into details to justify his
treachery, and a letter from the English commander,
Robertson, who, in a very insolent manner, demanded
that the adjutant-general should be delivered up to
them, as he had only acted with the permission of General
Arnold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was one of the fourteen generals who tried
Major André, and who were forced to the painful decision
that the interests of America demanded that he
should suffer the extreme penalty of the law, as a spy,
which was death by hanging. Washington would have
been glad to exchange André for the traitor Arnold, that
to him might be meted out his just deserts; but Sir
Henry Clinton would not give up Arnold, though he
made efforts to save André. Arnold’s villany was afterwards
rewarded by the commission of brigadier-general
in the British army, and he was placed at the head of
some English troops then ravaging the southern part of
Virginia. His malignant spirit gloated in acts of atrocious
cruelty, and he allowed his men to pillage and destroy,
sparing neither old nor young, neither women nor
children.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette now entered upon a series of marches,
man&oelig;uvres, skirmishes, and strategic expeditions, which
ended at last in the capture of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown:
this was largely due to La Fayette’s successive
masterly stratagems and skilful plans. It has been said
of La Fayette, that his name was never tarnished by a
single military blunder. Others have displayed equal
courage in the face of dangers, and calmness on the field
of battle, but his military genius consisted in a tact
and skill in extricating an army from apparently insurmountable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>perils that would have baffled veteran
generals well versed in the stratagems of war.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the untiring soldier was none the less a tender
father and devoted husband; in the midst of preparations
for the coming campaign he snatches a moment to
write thus fondly to his “dearest heart”:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Americans continue to testify for me the greatest
kindness. There is no proof of affection which I do
not receive each day from the army and nation. I experience
for the American officers and soldiers that friendship
which arises from having shared with them for a
length of time dangers, sufferings, and both good and
evil fortune. We began by struggling together, for our
affairs have often been at the lowest possible ebb. It
is gratifying to me to crown this work with them by
giving the European troops a high idea of the soldiers
who have been allied with us. To all these motives of
interest for the cause and the army are joined my sentiments
of regard for General Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Embrace our children a thousand and a thousand
times for me. Their father, although a wanderer, is not
less tender, nor less constantly occupied with them, and
not less happy at receiving news from them. My heart
dwells with peculiar delight on the moment when those
dear children will be presented to me by you, and when
we can embrace and caress them together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having sent this loving message across the sea, the
young knight-errant entered upon another campaign in
defence of liberty. Sir Henry Clinton had sent out two
thousand men under General Phillips to re-enforce Arnold
in Virginia. Learning this, Washington despatched
La Fayette to Virginia, to take command of the troops
there collecting, and to prevent, if possible, any junction
of Phillips with Cornwallis. The marquis was only too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>eager for active duty, and took up his line of march
with the troops previously under his charge, for Baltimore.
But these northern soldiers soon began to express
their dissatisfaction with such an expedition.
They were without tents, shoes, hats, and, as the marquis
said, “in a state of shocking nakedness”; and they
refused to continue this unlooked-for march. To render
his condition still more distressing, La Fayette was informed
by the Board of War that they were utterly
unable to render his troops any aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s nature seemed rather to be nerved by
obstacles to greater strength and superior judgment
than weakened and discouraged. A perplexing dilemma
was often his greatest opportunity. Washington
could not aid him, the Board of War announced themselves
powerless; and La Fayette was left to face his
overwhelming perplexities alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>He boldly issued an order to his troops, in which he
sympathized with their hardships, and frankly told them
that he was about to enter upon an enterprise, of great
difficulty and danger, and expressed his confidence that
his soldiers would join him in the hazardous expedition.
But if any should be unwilling to accompany him, he
assured them that a free permit would be given them to
join their corps in the North, and that by applying to
him, they could be saved from the crime and disgrace of
desertion. Not a man after that left the heroic band,
and a lame sergeant hired a place in a cart that he
might keep up with the army.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arriving at Baltimore, La Fayette borrowed upon his
personal credit ten thousand dollars, which he immediately
appropriated to supplying the needs of his soldiers.
He wrote to General Greene thus:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“As our brave and excellent men are shockingly destitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of linen, I have borrowed, from the merchants of
Baltimore a sum on my credit which will amount to
to about two thousand pounds, and will procure hats,
shoes, blankets, and a pair of linen overalls to each
man. I hope to set the Baltimore ladies at work upon
the shirts, which will be sent after me, and the overalls
will be made by our tailors. I will use my influence to
have the money added to the loan which the French
court have made to the United States, and in case I cannot
succeed, bind myself to the merchants for payment,
with interest, in two years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Most willingly did the ladies of Baltimore give their
aid in preparing garments for the troops, and La Fayette
proceeded with his division towards Virginia. Phillips
and Arnold had separated their forces for a time, that
they might better carry on their work of pillaging;
but in April they reunited their divisions, and planned
an attack upon Richmond.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the vigilant marquis was before them; marching
with great celerity, he entered and took possession of
the city, and was there joined by Baron Steuben, with
his corps of regular troops, and by General Nelson, with
a band of Virginia militia. The chagrin of the British
was intense when they discovered that they had been
outwitted by La Fayette and that he had gained this
important post.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette thus describes to Washington his position
at this time:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When General Phillips retreated from Richmond, his
project was to stop at Williamsburg, there to collect contributions
which he had imposed. This induced me to
take a position between Pamunkey and Chickahominy
rivers, which equally covered Richmond and some other
interesting parts of the state, and from where I detached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>General Nelson with some militia towards Williamsburg.
Having got as low down as that place, General Phillips
seemed to discover an intention to make a landing, but
upon advices received by a vessel from Portsmouth, the
enemy weighed anchor, and, with all the sail they could
crowd, hastened up the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This intelligence made me apprehensive that the enemy
intended to man&oelig;uvre me out of Richmond, where I returned
immediately, and again collected our small force.
Intelligence was the same day received that Lord Cornwallis—who,
I had been assured, had embarked at Wilmington—was
marching through North Carolina. This
was confirmed by the landing of General Phillips at
Brandon, south side of James River.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Apprehending that both armies would meet at a central
point, I marched towards Petersburg, and intended
to have established a communication over Appomattox
and James rivers; but on the 9th General Phillips took
possession of Petersburg, a place where, his right flank
being covered by James River, his front by Appomattox,
on which the brigades had been destroyed in the first
part of the invasion, and his left not being open to assault
except by a long circuit through fords that at this season
are very uncertain, I could not—even with an equal force—have
got any chance of fighting him unless I had given
up this side of James River and the country from which
re-enforcements are expected. It being the enemy’s choice
to force us to an action, while their own position insured
them against our enterprises, I thought it proper to shift
this situation, and marched the greater part of our troops
to this place [Welton], about ten miles below Richmond.
Letters from General Nash, General Jones, and General
Sumner are positive as to the arrival of Colonel Tarleton,
and announce that of Lord Cornwallis at Halifax.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Having received a request from North Carolina for
ammunition, I made a detachment of five hundred men,
under General Muhlenburg, to escort twenty thousand
cartridges over Appomattox, and, to divert the enemy’s
attention, Colonel Gimat, with his battalion and four field-pieces,
commanded their position from this side of the
river. I hope our ammunition will arrive safely, as before
General Muhlenburg returned he put it in a safe
road with proper directions. On the 13th General
Phillips died, and the command devolved upon General
Arnold. General Wayne’s detachment has not yet been
heard from. Before he arrives it becomes very dangerous
to risk an engagement where—as the British armies
are vastly superior to us—we shall certainly be beaten,
and by the loss of arms, the dispersion of militia, and the
difficulty of a junction with General Wayne, we may lose
a less dangerous chance of resistance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette, meanwhile, endeavored to strengthen his
forces, and so disciplined his troops that they became
prepared to act with the greatest efficiency and celerity
at a moment’s notice. It was at this time that La
Fayette received a letter from Arnold, in continuance of
a correspondence which the marquis had opened with
Phillips previous to his death, regarding an exchange
of prisoners. When the letter from the infamous traitor
was brought to him by a messenger, La Fayette refused
to touch the document, while he assured the bearer that
he would hold no communication whatever with its
author, adding, “In case any other English officer should
honor him with a letter, he would always be happy to
give the officers every testimony of esteem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Washington warmly commended this action,
and wrote to La Fayette: “Your conduct upon every
occasion meets my approbation, but in none more than in
your refusing to hold correspondence with Arnold.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Lord Cornwallis now assumed chief command of the
English army. On the 24th of May Cornwallis crossed
the James River, at the head of all his troops, and made
his first direct advance upon La Fayette. The marquis
had retreated to Richmond, and thus writes to Washington:
“Were I anyways equal to the enemy, I should be
extremely happy; but I am not strong enough even to
get beaten. The government in this state has no energy,
and the laws have no force; but I hope the present Assembly
will put matters on a better footing. I had a
great deal of trouble to put things in a tolerable train;
our expenses were enormous, and yet we can get nothing.
Arrangements for the present would seem to put on a
better face but for this superiority of the enemy, who
will chase us wherever they please. They can overrun
the country, and, until the Pennsylvanians arrive, we are
next to nothing in point of opposition to so large a force.
This country begins to be as familiar to me as Tappan
and Bergen. Our soldiers are hitherto very healthy. I
have turned doctor, and regulate their diet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The English looked with exultation and disdain upon
their apparently weak foe, and Lord Cornwallis wrote
with confidence, “<em>The boy cannot escape me!</em>” But the
despised “boy” was of a more heroic and irresistible nature
than the proud general imagined, and would yet
give him a most perplexing chase, and at length catch
his boastful foe in so cunning a trap that all the English
hosts could not deliver him; and this same “boy”
should stand by and witness his surrender.</p>

<div id='i108'  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i-108.jpg' alt='Cornwallis' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>For some time a sort of military game of “hide-and-seek”
was kept up by Lord Cornwallis and La Fayette.
It was Cornwallis’ plan to entrap him; it was La Fayette’s
plan to elude him. The marquis moved his division with
such unexpected celerity, that when the English general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>thought that he had him securely hedged in at any particular
point, he would straightway find, to his chagrin,
that his antagonist was miles away, sometimes before
him, sometimes behind him, now on this side, then on
that, and on one occasion, in order to guard some valuable
stores at Albemarle Old Court House, La Fayette
passed his foe in the night; and while Cornwallis supposed
that he had so disposed of his force that the enemy
must be entrapped, and smiled to himself at the easy
manner in which the prey would fall into his hands in
the morning, as all the roads to Albemarle Court House
had been carefully guarded, the marquis played his own
little strategic game, and when the day dawned, the
proud English lord, with deep mortification, received
tidings that his adversary was already before him, on
the direct road to Albemarle, and his English lordship
had been baffled in securing either the coveted stores or
the more coveted American army.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 6th of July occurred a brisk skirmish between
the opposing forces. The British army were crossing
the James River, on the march from Williamsburg to
Portsmouth. La Fayette, thinking that the larger part
of the troops had already crossed, ordered an attack to
be made upon what he supposed to be the rear-guard.
This time he had indeed fallen into one of Lord Cornwallis’
traps. In order to deceive the Americans, only a
small detachment had been sent forward, and when it
was attacked by the force under General Wayne, known
as “Mad Antony,” the little band of Americans found
themselves facing the entire English force. La Fayette,
who was stationed at a short distance with the main
army, rightly conjectured, from the very heavy firing,
that more than a rear-guard were engaged, and sent
assistance to Wayne, with orders to fall back. So swift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>had been the attack and so sudden the retreat, that
Cornwallis suspected a snare, and did not follow up his
triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Wayne thus described the attack: “This was
a severe conflict. Our field officers were generally dismounted
by having their horses killed or wounded under
them. I will not condole with the marquis for the loss
of two of his as he was frequently requested to keep at
a greater distance. His natural bravery rendered him
deaf to admonition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Wayne’s conduct was thus praised by La
Fayette: “It is enough for the glory of General Wayne
and the officers and men he commanded to have attacked
the whole British army with a reconnoitring party only,
close to their encampment, and by this severe skirmish
hastened their retreat over the river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Active warfare was now for a time suspended. Cornwallis
was intrenched at Portsmouth, and La Fayette
occupied himself in watching his enemy with untiring
vigilance. The marquis succeeded in having his own
servant hired by Cornwallis as a spy, and by this means,
as the man was always true to his first master, La Fayette
was enabled to keep well posted concerning all the
movements in the opposing encampment.</p>

<p class='c010'>To General Washington La Fayette thus writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am an entire stranger to everything that passes
out of Virginia, and Virginia operations being for the
present in a state of languor, I have more time to think
of my solitude. In a word, my dear General, I am
homesick, and if I cannot go to headquarters, wish, at
least, to hear from thence. I am anxious to know your
opinion concerning the Virginia campaign. That the
subjugation of this state was the great object of the
ministry is an indisputable fact. I think your diversion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>has been of more use to the state than my man&oelig;uvres,
but the latter have been much directed by political views.
So long as my lord wished for an action, not one gun has
been fired; but the moment he declined it, we began
skirmishing, though I took care never to commit the
army. His naval superiority, his superiority of horse,
of regulars, his thousand advantages over us, are such
that I am lucky to have come off safe. I had an eye
upon European negotiations, and made it a point to give
his lordship the disgrace of a retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From every account, it appears that a part of the
army will embark. The light infantry, the guards, the
80th Regiment, and Queen’s Rangers are, it is said, destined
for New York. Lord Cornwallis, I am told, is
much disappointed in his hopes of command. Should
he go to England, we are, I think, to rejoice for it. He
is a cold and active man,—two dangerous qualities in
this southern war.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The clothing you long ago sent to the light infantry
has not yet arrived. I have been obliged to send for it,
and expect it in a few days. These three battalions are
the best troops that ever took the field. My confidence
in them is unbounded. They are far superior to any
British troops, and none will ever venture to meet them
in equal numbers. What a pity these men are not
employed along with the French grenadiers; they would
do eternal honor to our arms! But their presence here,
I must confess, has saved this state, and, indeed, the
southern part of the continent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hearing that the expected French fleet was to arrive in
Chesapeake Bay, instead of New York harbor, the contemplated
attack upon New York was abandoned by
Washington, and Virginia was chosen as the scene of
action. Washington accordingly prepared for a southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>movement with great prudence and secrecy. Count
de Rochambeau was in favor of the expedition, and
readily assented to join Washington’s forces with the
French under his command. For a time Washington
did not dare to make known his plans to La Fayette,
lest his despatches should fall into the hands of the
enemy; but he requested La Fayette to remain in Virginia,
adding, “You will not regret this, especially when
I tell you that, from the change of circumstances with
which the removal of part of the enemy’s forces from
Virginia to New York will be attended, it is more than
probable we shall also entirely change our plan of
operations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This hint was sufficient for the keen-witted marquis,
who answered: “I am of the opinion, with you, that I
had better remain in Virginia. I have pretty well
understood you, my dear General, but should be happy
to have more minute details, which, I am aware, cannot
be intrusted to letters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette also wrote to his wife: “It was not prudent
in the general to confide to me such a command. If I
had been unfortunate, the public would have called that
partiality an error of judgment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Washington well knew the character and capacity
of the young marquis, and trusted him probably more than
his older and more experienced generals. La Fayette had
already proved that his courage would never lead him
to make rash ventures, but when hazardous enterprises
were necessary, no danger could unnerve him, and no
unexpected dilemma could confuse him.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 30th of August the French fleet under Count
de Grasse arrived. The Marquis de Saint-Simon landed
with three thousand men, and La Fayette joined his
force to them and took up a strong position at Williamsburg.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Washington having completely outwitted General
Clinton, by feigning an intended attack on New York,
had started on the 19th of August, with the entire
American army, and, crossing the Hudson, they began
their march to Virginia.</p>

<p class='c010'>In announcing their departure to La Fayette, Washington
wrote to the marquis, enjoining upon him the
closest watchfulness, lest the enemy should escape his
vigilance, adding: “As it will be of great importance
towards the success of our present enterprise that the
enemy, on the arrival of the fleet, should not have it
in their power to effect retreat, I cannot omit to repeat
to you my most earnest wish that the land and naval
forces which you will have with you may so combine
their operations that the British army may not be able
to escape. The particular mode of doing this I shall
not, at this distance, attempt to dictate. Your own
knowledge of the country, from your long continuance
in it, and the various and extensive movements which
you have made, have given you great opportunities for
observation, of which I am persuaded your military
genius and judgment will lead you to make the best
improvement. You will, my dear Marquis, keep me
constantly advised of every important event respecting
the enemy or yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Cornwallis, who had taken his position at York and
Gloucester, where he had been actively engaged in erecting
heavy fortifications, now suddenly found himself
completely surrounded by his foes, being blockaded by
sea and land, with hardly a possibility of escape. He
sent an urgent request to Sir Henry Clinton for succor,
and finding, after having carefully reconnoitred La
Fayette’s position at Williamsburg, that any attempt
to pass it and retreat to the South would be useless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>he awaited with impatience his expected re-enforcements.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Layette’s loyalty to Washington and his faithful
obedience was at this time severely tried. As the Count
de Grasse had permission to serve on the American
coast only until the middle of October, and as he and
the Marquis St. Simon were anxious to distinguish themselves,
they urged La Fayette to make an immediate
attack upon the enemy, without awaiting the arrival of
Washington and the Count de Rochambeau. “It is
right,” they argued, “that you who have had all the
difficulties of this campaign should now be rewarded
with the glory of its successful termination.” They
represented that the incomplete state of the fortifications
of Cornwallis made his defeat sure, as he could not
resist a sudden attack. These were powerful reasons to
the young and impulsive marquis; but his loyalty and
better judgment prevailed, and he resisted all appeals to
commence the attack, and waited in patience the arrival
of Washington and Rochambeau.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 14th of September Washington and Rochambeau
arrived at Williamsburg, and La Fayette was
rejoiced to behold the consummation of one of his
fondest wishes, which was to see Washington at the
head of the united French and American armies.
Plans were immediately completed for the siege of
Yorktown. Washington highly approved of all the
measures adopted by La Fayette, and a brilliant success
seemed certain.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a new difficulty unexpectedly arose, which was
only removed by the persuasive influence of La Fayette.
Information reached the French admiral that the British
fleet in New York had received important additions, and
he thereupon determined to sail directly against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>English fleet. Washington perceived that if they were
deserted by the French fleet, their victory over Cornwallis
might be very uncertain. He accordingly wrote a
letter to Count de Grasse, and sent it by La Fayette,
urging the marquis to use his personal influence to prevent
this calamity. La Fayette realized the crisis of
affairs, and successfully appealed to the count; and the
French fleet therefore remained to aid the American
army.</p>

<p class='c010'>The troops from the North having arrived on the
28th, the entire army, moving forward in four columns,
halted about twelve miles in front of the enemy, and the
famous siege of Yorktown was begun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The investment was complete. Cornwallis looked out
in vain for any chance to escape. The Americans gradually
surrounded the town with earthworks, redoubts,
and trenches, and on the night of the 6th of October a
trench seven hundred feet was commenced within six
hundred yards of the British lines. So silently was this
work done by the French and Americans that the garrison
was entirely unaware of it until daylight, by which
time the embankments were so high as to shield the
men from the enemy’s fire. Batteries and redoubts were
speedily erected, and such an unrelenting cannonading
was kept up against the garrison that they were forced
to withdraw their cannon from the embrasures; and
most of their batteries were torn in pieces. On the
night of the 11th, Washington opened his second parallel
within three hundred yards of the lines. This,
like the former, was begun noiselessly and was not discovered
by Cornwallis until the next morning. There
were two redoubts of the English that seriously interfered
with the work of the besiegers, by a constant fire.
Washington determined to attack them. La Fayette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>was appointed to lead the Americans, who should attack
one of the redoubts, and the Baron de Viomesnil led
a band of Frenchmen against the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The baron had once remarked to La Fayette that he
thought the French method of attack superior to that
of the Americans. La Fayette answered, “We are but
young soldiers, and we have but one sort of tactics on
such occasions, which is to discharge our muskets and
push on straight with our bayonets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Both leaders were now to carry out their preconceived
military tactics. La Fayette made an impetuous attack
and captured the redoubt, and still hearing firing from
the other, he sent his aide-de-camp to the baron, inquiring
if he should send him assistance. Viomesnil answered,
“Tell the marquis that I am not yet master of
my redoubt, but that I shall be in less than five minutes.”
He kept his word, and before that time had
passed, he entered his captured redoubt in perfect military
order. Both had been equally successful; but La
Fayette was ahead as to time, and the baron, in following
strict military rule, was forced to expose his men to
a terrible fire from the enemy. The bravery with which
this difficult onset was made was highly gratifying to
Washington; and he complimented both officers in the
orders for the succeeding day. The captured redoubts
were included in the second parallel, and soon some
howitzers were mounted upon them, and their destructive
fire was turned upon the besieged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cornwallis now determined to make a bold effort, and
he sent out Lieutenant-Colonel Abercrombie at the head
of eight hundred chosen men to make a desperate sortie
against two batteries of the besieging enemy. So valiant
was their charge that they gained possession and spiked
four guns, but they were repelled by the Chevalier de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Chastellux, and forced to retire. The condition of Cornwallis
was now desperate. His ordnance had been
dismounted by the terrible firing of the Americans, his
walls were crumbling, and nearly all his defences were
razed. He resolved to try one more daring design. This
was to cross over in the night to Gloucester Point, with
such of his troops as were not disabled, and endeavor by
forced marches to join the army in New York. The
attempt was made, and one division passed over unperceived
by the Americans, but a violent storm suddenly
arose and drifted the boats down the river, and the plan
was abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the morning of the 17th Lord Cornwallis opened
negotiations and offered to capitulate. On the 19th
formal articles of surrender were signed, and Cornwallis
and his army were made prisoners of war. “The
Americans and French took possession at noon of two
bastions, and the garrison defiled between the armies at
two o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, with drums beating, carrying their
arms, which they afterwards piled, with twenty pair of
colors. Lord Cornwallis feigned sickness, to avoid surrendering
before his soldiers, and General O’Hara accordingly
appeared at the head of the garrison. ‘When he
came up,’ says Rochambeau, ‘he presented his sword to
me. I pointed to General Washington, who was opposite
me, at the head of the American army, and
told him that the French army being auxiliaries on
the continent, it was the American general who was to
signify his orders to him.’ As the result of this capitulation
8000 prisoners, of whom 7000 were regular troops
and 1000 sailors; 214 pieces of cannon, of which 75
were brass; and 22 pair of colors, passed into the hands
of the allies. The men, artillery, arms, military chest,
and public stores of every denomination were surrendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to Washington, the ships and seamen to the
Count de Grasse.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c010'>Lord Cornwallis sent a messenger to La Fayette, “to
tell the marquis that, after having made this long campaign
against him, he wished to give him a private
account of the reasons which had led him to surrender.”
The next day La Fayette went to see him. “I know,”
said the English general, “your humanity to prisoners,
and I recommend my poor army to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, my lord,” replied La Fayette, “the Americans
have always been humane towards imprisoned
armies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus did La Fayette refuse even to accept a compliment
which seemed to separate him from his American
comrades in arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bells in every town and hamlet throughout the
country rang out the joyful news of this great victory.
Bonfires blazed on every hill-top. Congress repaired in
solemn procession to the Dutch Lutheran church, to return
thanks to God for this providential deliverance.
The names of Washington and La Fayette, Rochambeau
and De Grasse, resounded throughout the world. The
commander-in-chief ordered that suitable religious services
should be held in camp in honor of that Divine
Providence who had vouchsafed to them this great blessing.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 20th of October, 1781, La Fayette thus wrote
to M. de Maurepas:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Camp</span>, near York.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The tragedy is over; the piece is played, Monsieur

<p class='c010'>“I had a little torture during the first, but at last my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>heart experiences a lively joy, and it gives me not a little
pleasure to congratulate you upon the happy success of
our campaign.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot give you the details, Monsieur le Comte,
which I intrust to Lauzun, to whom I wish much happiness
in crossing the ocean, which he will traverse with
the corps of the legion of Tarleton.</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. de Rochambeau brings to you the account relative
to the army which he commands; but if the honor
of having commanded for so long a time the division of
M. de Saint-Simon gives me the right to speak of my
obligations to that general and to his troops, this duty
will give me infinite delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you kindly, Monsieur le Comte, present my
homage to Madame la Comtesse de Maurepas and to
Madame de Flamarens, and accept the assurance of my
affection, of my remembrances, and of my respect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>From the same place La Fayette wrote also to M. de
Vergennes, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Receive my congratulations, Monsieur le Comte, upon
the fortunate turn which has at last come to politics.
M. de Lauzun will give you all the details. I am happy
that our campaign of Virginia has been so well finished;
and my respect for the ability of Lord Cornwallis renders
his capture all the more precious to me. After this
attempt what English general will come to place himself
at the head to conquer America?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Their Southern man&oelig;uvres have not ended more

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>From on board the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Ville de Paris</em></span>, in the Chesapeake
Bay, La Fayette thus writes to his wife:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Oct. 22, 1781.</span></div>

<p class='c010'>“Behold the last instant, my dear heart, in which it
is possible for me to write you. M. de Lauzun is about
to join the frigate and depart for Europe. Some business
with the admiral affords me the pleasure of giving
to you the latest news of the past two days.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That which has occurred regarding public events
will be detailed by M. de Lauzun. The end of this
campaign is truly brilliant for the allied armies. There
has been in our movements a rare harmony, and I
should have been much disappointed had I not the
satisfaction of this happy ending of my campaign in
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are aware of all the difficulties that the superiority
and the talents of Lord Cornwallis have occasioned
us; the advantage which we had following the recovery
of the territory lost, and which ended in the position
which we forced Lord Cornwallis to take; it was at that
moment that everybody rushed in upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I count amongst my many pleasant experiences
the time when the division of M. de Saint-Simon was
reunited to my army; and, also, when I alternately
commanded the three adjutant-generals with the troops
under their order. I pity Lord Cornwallis, of whom I
have the most exalted opinion. He wished to test
such estimation, and after the capitulation gave me the
pleasure of returning the incivility of Charleston. I
do not purpose to carry vengeance any further.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My health is excellent. I have not received any injury
during my operations. Present my most tender
homage to Madame d’Ayen, to M. le Maréchal de

</div>

<p class='c010'>Washington desired to follow up the advantages which
the Americans had gained, by an expedition against
Charleston; but as De Grasse had prior orders from
his sovereign, preventing his remaining longer in America,
the project was abandoned, and the American army
retired into winter quarters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again La Fayette sought permission from Congress to
visit his native land, and after receiving the highest
testimonials from Washington and Congress, and also
from the king and ministry of France, he sailed from
Boston in the frigate <em>Alliance</em>, on the 22d of December,
1781.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest enthusiasm was excited by La Fayette’s
arrival in France. Royal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>salons</em></span> courted his presence,
and high-born dames and gallant cavaliers vied to do
him homage. Even sovereigns deigned to note with
especial honor his return. Madame de La Fayette was
present at a grand fête at the Hôtel de Ville, in celebration
of the Dauphin’s birth, when the news was proclaimed
that La Fayette, the conqueror of Cornwallis,
had just arrived; and, sympathizing with the impatient
joy of the fond wife, the queen herself ordered her
carriage and accompanied Madame de La Fayette to the
Hôtel de Noailles, where La Fayette had just alighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The joy of the reunion between La Fayette and his
family is more fittingly told in the words of his daughter
Virginie than by another.</p>

<p class='c010'>Speaking of her father’s second visit to America, she
says:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“My father left France once more for America, where
the war still continued. The grief which my mother
felt was still greater than at his first departure. Her
attachment had been increased both by her anxieties on
his account and by the enchanting moments she had
spent with him. She was then nineteen. Her impressions
had become stronger and deeper; a more intimate
and serious confidence had associated her riper intellect
with my father’s opinions and designs: her mind was
with him as well as her heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nevertheless, what she suffered during the campaign
of Virginia surpassed all she had yet endured. As the
English papers, which alone brought any news, always
depicted the situation as desperate, the most disastrous
reports came to her knowledge; but she had the courage
to hide them from her mother, and endeavored to
bear all her sufferings alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The brilliant conclusion of that campaign which had
been conducted by my father, and had ended by the capture
of Lord Cornwallis, caused her a happiness which
had been purchased by prolonged sufferings. My father
arrived unexpectedly in Paris on the 21st of January,
1782. The joy of seeing him again, returned with so
much glory out of so many dangers, and the fascination
of his presence, were intensely felt by my mother. So
overpowering were her feelings that for several months
she felt ready to faint every time he left the room. She
was alarmed at the vehemence of her passion, fearing
that she could not always conceal it from my father, and
that it might become annoying to him, and she therefore
endeavored to restrain it for his sake only.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This touching little scene of an ideal love-life is a
charming picture in La Fayette’s history. Scarcely anywhere
in history can be found the record of two souls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in such perfect harmony of thought and feeling as the
Marquis and Marquise de La Fayette. To the end their
life was unmarred by the least discord or misunderstanding.
The world crowned him with honor; and he
laid at her feet his diadem of glory, and felt himself
rewarded by her tender smile of approving love.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is fitting that we should here quote a few lines from
a letter written to Washington by La Fayette, in October,
1782, announcing the birth of this same Virginie,
who afterwards became such a faithful narrator of the
beautiful life of the Marquis and Marquise de La Fayette.
The marquis says:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: Since the arrival of Colonel
Gimat not one line from you has come to me; this afflicts
me intensely, because when I have not the pleasure of
being with you it is absolutely necessary for me that I
should receive letters from you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This will be handed to you by General Dupontail
and Colonel Gouvion, who return to America. I wish I
could do the same; but you know that I am detained here
by the American plenipotentiaries, in the hope of serving
our cause, which is always to me the principal object.</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Dupontail will give you the public news; I
have communicated those of a more secret nature to the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and I have requested him
to transmit my letter to your Excellency. You will be
able to form your opinion upon the situation of affairs;
but although their progress does not permit me (on
account of the reasons which I have already explained)
to leave this country at the present time, my personal
opinion is, that a victory is necessary before a general
peace can be brought to a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have charged Colonel Gouvion to say to you those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>things which had better not be written, relative to my
projects.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame La Fayette desires me to present to you,
also to Madame Washington, her respects and affectionate
regards. She has a little daughter, just arrived; and
though the infant is somewhat delicate, I hope that she
will grow up strong. I have taken the liberty of giving
to her the name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Virginie</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beseech you, my dear General, to present my respects
to Madame Washington, and my affectionate compliments
to the family. I hope that my conduct, guided
by the motives of seeking the greatest public good, and
for American interests, will receive from you that approbation
which I prefer to that from all the rest of the
world. Adieu, my dear General!”</p>

<div class='c011'>—<span class='sc'>Daniel Webster.</span></div>

</div>
<p class='c009'>LA FAYETTE in France was not unmindful of the
interests of America. Largely through his influence
a grand armament was put in preparation by France and
Spain, to encounter the British power in the West Indies
and North America. Sixty vessels and twenty-four thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>men assembled at Cadiz. La Fayette was appointed
chief of the staff of both armies. These vast preparations
were looked upon by England with alarm, and
quickened their negotiations with the United States for
arranging a peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this time La Fayette wrote the following letter to
Washington, dated at Brest, December, 1782, and marked
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Tout-à-fait confidentielle</em></span>”:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: My preceding letters have apprised
you that though the politicians speak much of
peace, an expedition is about to take place, of which the
command has been given to Count d’Estaing. I will add
that, having been solicited to take part in it, I have
accepted willingly, thinking it was the only means in
the world of succeeding in that which you have charged
me to obtain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colonel Gouvion ought to be with you, and I refer,
my dear General, to that letter which I have sent to you
by him; also to some notes which I have written in
cipher. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Les Antilles</em></span> are the first object. Spain will come
after. We have nine ships of the line to send by the
first favorable wind. Your Excellency knows that the
Count d’Estaing has gone to Spain. We have the maritime
superiority. Will you prepare your propositions
and your projects relative to New York, Charleston,
Penobscot, and the New World? A French vessel will
be sent to America, and from there, by your orders, to
the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will write you by the next opportunity. I have
the honor of sending to you, with this, a copy of a letter
to Congress. I hope that you can say that you are satisfied
with my conduct. In truth, my dear General, it is
necessary to my happiness that you should think thus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>When you are absent, I strive to do that which seems
to me that you would have counselled if you had been
present. I love you too much to be for a moment satisfied
unless I can think that you approve my conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They talk much of the peace. I think, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>entre nous</em></span>,
that the greatest difficulty will come from the Spaniards,
and, moreover, I believe that the enemies are not sincere.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have piled up disputes and artifices <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à propos</em></span> to
the question of the American limits, and thus it rests.
My opinion is, that at the bottom of their hearts they
are determined, if they can, to attempt to bring about
some turn of their affairs in the next campaign. God
grant that we shall be able to make a vigorous effort,
particularly as regards New York.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I arrived here but yesterday morning, and am much
occupied with the affairs of the service.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>On the 20th of January, 1783, the final treaty was
signed. La Fayette was then at Cadiz preparing to sail
to America, bearing the news of the glad tidings of peace,
when an occurrence took place which revealed the unselfishness
of his ambition, and the loyalty of his love for
America. Mr. Carmichael, who had been appointed by
Congress <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Chargé d’Affaires</em></span> to the court of Madrid, was
not received by the king of Spain in his diplomatic
relation, although that monarch had signed the treaty
acknowledging the independence of the States. In this
emergency, Mr. Carmichael wrote to La Fayette, seeking
his aid. The marquis generously determined to deprive
himself of the great pleasure of announcing to Washington
the joyful news of the treaty; and he therefore sent
a letter to the President of Congress, communicating the
tidings of peace, while he himself hastened to Madrid
to negotiate in behalf of the honor of America; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>obtained from the king the full recognition of the American
ambassador in his official character.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following is the memorable letter of La Fayette
to Congress, announcing the treaty of peace:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>To the President of Congress.</em></div>
      <div class='line in9'>“<span class='sc'>Cadiz</span>, Feb. 5, 1783.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: With such celerity as I can despatch a ship, I
hope to inform Congress of the news of a general peace.
Moreover, such are my sentiments under these circumstances
that I cannot delay to present my felicitations.
These sentiments one can judge of better through a
knowledge of my heart, which, by means of such expressions,
can only feebly render its emotions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember our former times with pleasure and with
pride. Our present situation renders me happy. I behold
in the future a tempting prospect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The preceding letters have made known to Congress
how, until now, I had the intention of leaving France.
I have been detained by some despatches. I refer to
my letter of the 3d for a fuller explanation of my
conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now the noble struggle is ended. I rejoice in the
benefits of peace. There are here anchored nine ships
of the line, with twenty thousand men, with whom the
Count d’Estaing was about to join the combined forces
of the West Indies, and which would have co-operated
with our American army. It had even been arranged
that while the Count d’Estaing was employed elsewhere,
I should enter the St. Lawrence at the head of a French
corps. For that which concerns myself, I have no regrets;
but independent of personal considerations, you know
that I have always longed for the addition of Canada
to the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I promised myself to return to America after the peace.
Notwithstanding the pain of being detained, it is necessary
to defer this voyage. Any sacrifice will not be
counted by me for the accomplishment of my duties;
and since it has pleased Congress to order that their
ministers should consult with me, my first interest is to
merit their confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From my letter to M. Livingston, one can form an
opinion of our situation in Spain. They have demanded
my aid, and I have given it. They desire my services,
and instead of departing for America I will go to
Madrid, which is so far from my plan; but I believe
that it will be better for me to go there during the residence
of Mr. Jay in Paris; so that nothing shall hinder
me, unless Congress honors me with their orders. I
shall embark in the coming June, because I am very
eager to behold again the American shores.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-day our noble cause has triumphed; our independence
is firmly established; and American virtue has
obtained its recompense. I hope no efforts will be neglected
to strengthen the federal union.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May the states be always strongly united in a manner
to defy European intrigues! Upon such union will
repose their importance and their happiness. This is
the first wish of a heart most truly American, and which
cannot refrain from expressing these words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,
etc.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>After divers negotiations attempted from the commencement
of the year 1782, the preliminaries of a peace
between France and England were signed at Versailles,
on the 20th of January, 1783, by M. de Vergennes and
Mr. Fitz-Herbert, plenipotentiary of his British Majesty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>These preliminaries were converted into a definite treaty
of peace the 3d of September, 1783. It was signed, for
France, by M. de Vergennes; for Spain, by the Count
d’Aranda; and for England, by the Duke of Manchester.
The final treaty between Great Britain and the United
States was signed at Paris, Jan. 20, 1783, by Mr.
David Hartly, on the one side, and by Messrs. John
Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay, on the other
side. This sitting had also concluded at Paris the peculiar
treaty between Great Britain and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>états-généraux</em></span>
of Holland.</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot refrain from quoting also a portion of the
delightful letter written to Washington by La Fayette,
of the same date as the above communication, addressed
to Congress.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: If you were such a man as
Cæsar, or as the king of Prussia, I should have been
much grieved for you to behold the grand tragedy terminated,
in which you have played so great a rôle. But I
congratulate myself with my dear general over this
peace which has accomplished all our wishes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Recall to your mind our times at Valley Forge, and
let the remembrance of those past dangers and afflictions
add greater joy to the happiness of our present situation.
What sentiments of pride and satisfaction I feel in pondering
upon the circumstances which determined my
engagement in the cause of America! As for you, my
dear General, one can truly say that it is all your work;
such must be the sentiments of your good and virtuous
heart, in this happy moment which establishes and
which crowns the revolution which you have made.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel that every one will envy the happiness of my
descendants, as they cherish and honor your name. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>have had one of their ancestors amongst your soldiers,
to know that he had the happy fortune to be the friend
of your heart, will be an eternal honor in which they
will glory; and I shall bequeath to the eldest amongst
them, down to the latest of my posterity, the favor
which you have been willing to confer upon my son
George.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was intending to go to America with the news of
the peace. You know me too well, my dear General, not
to judge of the pleasure which I felt in advance, at the
hope of embracing you and being reunited to my companions
in arms. Nothing could please me so much as
that delightful prospect; but I have been suddenly forced
to change the execution of my favorite plan, and as I
have had at last the happiness of receiving a letter from
you, I know that you will approve of my prolonging my
absence, for political motives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A copy both of my letter to Congress and that which
I have written officially to M. Livingston, requesting that
they may be communicated to you, will inform you more
fully of the reasons which press me to depart for
Madrid. After that, I shall go to Paris, and in the
month of June embark for America. Happy, ten-times
happy shall I be to embrace my dear general, my father,
my best friend, whom I cherish with an affection and
respect which I feel so deeply that I know it is impossible
to express it!</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will see by my letter to Congress that independently
of the plans which had been proposed to you, and
for which were united immense forces by sea and land,
it had at length been decided that I should enter into
Canada. I have had the hope of embracing you at Montreal,
when I was to have been joined by a detachment
of the army. The necessity of some diversion secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>for us the consent of Spain; but these projects have
vanished, and we ought to console ourselves in thinking
of the happiness of that part of the continent to which
you have given deliverance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am impatient, my dear General, to hear from you,
and to inform you of myself, for which purpose I send
my servant by this vessel, and for whom I have arranged
that he be landed on the coast of Maryland. I hope
to receive your reply before leaving France, and I shall
be then where I wish to go. If you are at home, I will
direct my way toward the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot, my dear General, employ your influence
more wisely than to persuade the American people to
strengthen the federal ties. This is a task which appeals
to your heart, and I consider this result as necessary.
Be assured that the European politicians will be disposed
to create a division amongst the states. This is the
time when the powers of Congress ought to be fixed,
their possible limits determined, and the Articles of Confederation
revised. This work, which should interest
all the friends of America, is the last test; this is wanting
to the perfection of the temple of Liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the army, my dear General! What is to be its
future? I hope that the country will be grateful. If it
is otherwise, I shall be very unhappy. Our part of the
army, will they remain united? If not, I hope that
we shall not lose our noble titles as officers and soldiers
of the American army; and that in a time of danger
we can be recalled from all corners of the world, and
reunited for the defence of a country which has been
so heroically saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am anxious to know the measures which will be
taken. Truly, I count upon your kindness to write me
a very detailed letter, not only in the public interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>but also because I have the desire to be informed of all
that which concerns you personally.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Adieu! adieu, my dear General! If the Spaniards
had common sense, I should have been spared this
wretched journey to Madrid, but I am called there by a
duty to America.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us return, at present, to our own affairs; for
I will urge you to return to France with me. The best
way to arrange it will be for Madame Washington to
accompany you. She will render Madame de La Fayette
and myself perfectly happy. I pray your Excellency
to offer my compliments to Tilghman, to George, to all
the staff. Remember me to all my friends in the army.
Have the kindness to speak of me to your respected
mother. I wish her happiness, with all my soul. Adieu,
yet once more, my dear General, with all the sentiments,
etc.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s letter, bearing its weighty message, was
sent in a fast-sailing vessel appropriately named <em>The
Triumph</em>. This ship arrived in Philadelphia on the
23d of March, 1783, bringing to Congress the intelligence
of the treaty of peace. Testimonials in honor of La
Fayette were passed by Congress, and Washington wrote
to him these words of commendation:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is easier for you to conceive, than for me to
express, the sensibility of my heart at the communication
of your letter of the 5th of February, from Cadiz.
It is to these communications we are indebted for the
only account yet received of a general pacification. My
mind, upon the receipt of this intelligence, was instantly
assailed by a thousand ideas, all of them contending for
pre-eminence; but, believe me, my dear friend, none
could supplant or ever will eradicate that gratitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>which has arisen from a lively sense of the conduct of
your nation, and to my obligations to many of its illustrious
characters (of whom, without flattery, I place you
at the head), and from my admiration of your august
sovereign, who, at the same time that he stands confessed
the father of his own people, and the defender of
American rights, has given the most exalted example of
moderation in treating with his enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The armament which was preparing at Cadiz, and in
which you were to have acted a distinguished part,
would have carried such conviction with it, that it is
not to be wondered at that Great Britain should have
been impressed with the force of such reasoning. To
this cause, I am persuaded, the peace is to be ascribed.
Your going to Madrid from thence, instead of coming
immediately to this country, is another instance, my
dear Marquis, of your zeal for the American cause, and
lays a fresh claim to the gratitude of her sons, who will
at all times receive you with open arms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>American independence having been secured, La Fayette
now interested himself in advancing the commercial
influence of America in France. The whale fishery was
an important American industry; and La Fayette, by
persevering efforts, secured a total exemption of duties
on sixteen thousand quintals of oil, to be furnished by
merchants of Boston to the contractor-general for lighting
the cities of Paris and Versailles. Regarding this
he modestly wrote: “I worked very hard to bring even
as much as this about, and am happy at having at last
obtained a point which may be agreeable to New England
and the people of Boston. I wish they may, at
large, know I did not neglect their affairs; and although
this is a kind of private bargain, yet as it amounts to a
value of about eight hundred thousand French livres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and government has been prevailed upon to take off all
duties, it must be considered a matter of no little importance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From the quiet retreat of Mount Vernon, Washington
wrote to the marquis, and renewed his previous invitation
to visit him when peace should have been accomplished.
The weary warrior thus pictures his retired
life:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At length I have become a private citizen on the
banks of the Potomac; and under the shadow of my
own vine and fig-tree, free from the bustle of the camp
and the busy scenes of public life, I am solacing myself
with those tranquil enjoyments of which the soldier,
who is ever in pursuit of fame; the statesman, whose
watchful days and sleepless nights are spent in devising
schemes to promote the welfare of his own, perhaps the
ruin of other countries (as if this globe was insufficient
for us all); and the courtier, who is always watching
the countenance of his prince, in the hope of catching
a gracious smile, can have very little conception. I
have not only retired from all public employments, but
am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the
solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with
heart-felt satisfaction. Envious of none, I am determined
to be pleased with all; and this, my dear friend,
being the order of my march, I will move gently down
the stream of life until I sleep with my fathers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again La Fayette turned his face toward the New
Land of Liberty. He arrived in New York in August,
1784, where he was received with distinguished honors,
and his journey to Philadelphia and Baltimore was a
succession of triumphs. Bells echoed from mountain-peak
to hill-top, cannon boomed their thunders of welcome,
and old Revolutionary soldiers gathered around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>their honored comrade with admiring respect. But he
hastened to the alluring heights of Mount Vernon,
where his beloved chief and general impatiently awaited
his arrival. Twelve days of delight he spent with
Washington in that picturesque retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Triumph after triumph yet awaited the nation’s
guest, the now illustrious but still youthful Marquis
de La Fayette; loved better in America as the valiant
major-general than as the gentleman of rank. But
amid all the cities that strove to do him honor, Boston,
this time, outstripped them all. His ovation there occurred
on the anniversary of the surrender of Cornwallis,
and the governor of the state, the president the Senate,
and the speaker of the House of Representatives assembled
in the great hall where thousands awaited to do
him honor. The apartment was brilliantly and appropriately
ornamented, and emblems of the thirteen states
of the Union floated from arch and pillar. After dinner
thirteen patriotic toasts were drunk, followed each by
thirteen guns stationed in the square without. As the
name of Washington was spoken, and La Fayette arose
to reply, a curtain behind the marquis was mysteriously
lifted, revealing a noble portrait of the great general
encircled with laurels and decorated with the entwined
flags of America and France. La Fayette, surprised and
moved, regarded those loved features with evident emotion,
and his silent admiration was at length broken by
a voice exclaiming, “<em>Long live Washington!</em>” And the
cry was quickly taken up, and from all the people rose a
shout of vociferous applause, “<em>Long live Washington!</em>”</p>

<p>LAFAYETTE’S ROOM AT MOUNT VERNON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Congress, then assembled at Trenton, tendered a farewell
to their illustrious guest; and to the courtly greeting
of Mr. Jay, chairman of the committee appointed to
wait upon him, La Fayette made this fitting reply:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“<em>May this immense temple of Freedom ever stand a
lesson to oppressors, an example to the oppressed, and a
sanctuary for the rights of mankind!</em> and may these
happy United States attain that complete splendor and
prosperity which will illustrate the blessings of their
government, and for ages to come rejoice the departed
souls of its founders!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And the echoes of La Fayette’s words come still rolling
down the years, “May this temple of Freedom
stand!”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s parting from Washington was most
tender and affecting. As the old general pressed to
his heart the youthful form of his beloved and adopted
son, tears filled his eyes, and La Fayette, too, looked
through dim mists, and both were proud to show their
mutual love.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a prophetic presentiment that they should never
meet again, Washington afterwards wrote to La Fayette
these touching words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the moment of our separation, and every hour
since, I have felt all that love, respect, and attachment
for you, with which length of years, close connection,
and your merits have inspired me. I often asked myself,
as our carriages separated, whether that was the
last sight I should ever have of you; and though I
wished to say no, my fears answered yes! I called to
mind the days of my youth, and found that they had
fled to return no more; that I was now descending the
hill I had been fifty years climbing, and that, though I
was blessed with a good constitution, I was of a short-lived
family, and might soon expect to be entombed in
the mansion of my fathers. These thoughts darkened
the shades and gave a gloom to the picture, and, consequently,
to my prospect of seeing you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>And truly this was their last meeting and their last
parting on this earth. When, in after years, La Fayette
again visited America, Washington slept under the sod
at Mount Vernon, and the sorrowful marquis could only
satisfy his affectionate remembrance of that ideal friendship
by dropping his silent tears upon the tomb of his
adopted father.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following act to naturalize Major-General the Marquis
de La Fayette and his heirs male forever was
passed November session, 1784, by the Assembly of
Maryland:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Whereas</em>, the General Assembly of Maryland anxious to perpetuate
a name dear to the state, and to recognize the Marquis
de La Fayette as one of its citizens, who, at the age of nineteen,
left his native country, and risked his life in the late revolution;
who, on his joining the American army, after being
appointed by Congress to the rank of major-general, disinterestedly
refused the usual reward of command, and sought only
to deserve, what he attained, the character of patriot and soldier;
who, when appointed to conduct an incursion into Canada,
called forth, by his prudence and extraordinary discretion,
the approbation of Congress; who, at the head of an army in
Virginia baffled the man&oelig;uvres of a distinguished general, and
excited the admiration of the oldest commanders; who early
attracted the notice and obtained the friendship of the illustrious
General Washington; and who labored and succeeded in
raising the honor and name of the United States of America:
Therefore,</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland</em>, That the
Marquis de La Fayette and his heirs male forever shall be,
and they, and each of them, are hereby deemed, adjudged, and
taken to be natural-born citizens of this state, and shall henceforth
be entitled to all the immunities, rights, and privileges
of natural-born citizens thereof, they and every one of them,
conforming to the constitution and laws of this state, in the
enjoyment and exercise of such immunities, rights, and privileges.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>A similar act was also passed by the legislature of
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette returned to Paris in January, 1785. During
this year the marquis visited the courts of many of
the German princes, and was everywhere received with
marked distinction. But the fawning of courtiers could
not move La Fayette from his declared position as an
upholder of freedom. Even old Frederick the Great
was forced to acknowledge the power of the impulsive
champion of liberty. La Fayette was invited by the
admiring tyrant to Sans Souci, and the Prussian monarch
treated him with distinguished consideration. Many
were their warm discussions upon liberty and the American
Revolution, the success of which made even the
haughty old king tremble on his tottering throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one of these conversations Frederick declared that
the American Republic would not last. “She will return
to the good old system by and by,” said he; to which La
Fayette, with earnestness, replied: “Never, Sire; never!
Neither monarchy nor aristocracy can ever exist in
America. Do you believe that I went to America to obtain
military reputation? It was for liberty I went there.
He who loves liberty can only remain quiet after having
established it in his own country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To which the old tyrant grimly and sarcastically answered:
“Sir, I knew a young man, who, after having
visited countries where liberty and equality reigned, conceived
the idea of establishing the same system in his
own country. Do you know what happened to him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Sire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was hanged,” said the old monarch, with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>When La Fayette took his leave of the Prussian warrior,
Frederick presented to the marquis his miniature set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>in diamonds, as a token of his admiring regard. In La
Fayette’s “Memoirs” he thus sketches Frederick the
Great as he appeared at the time of this visit:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been to Potsdam,” says the marquis, “to pay
my court to the king; and though I had heard much of
his appearance, I was not fully prepared to see him
dressed in an old, ragged, dirty uniform, all covered with
Spanish snuff, his head leaning over one shoulder, and
his fingers almost dislocated with gout. But what surprised
me most was the fire, and occasionally the softness,
in his eyes—the handsomest eyes I have ever
seen; so that his face can be as charming when he
is pleased as it can be stern and threatening at the
head of his army. I was in Silesia when he reviewed
thirty-one battalions and seventy-five squadrons—thirty
thousand men in all, seventy-five hundred of them being
cavalry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is with the greatest pleasure that I viewed the
Prussian army! nothing can be compared to the beauty
of the troops,—to the discipline which rules in all the
ranks, to the simplicity and uniformity of their movements.
It is a perfectly regular machine, wound up
these forty years, and which has not suffered from
other changes than those which could render it more
simple and more swift. All the situations which one
can suppose in a war, all the movements which ought
to be introduced, have been, by constant habit, so inculcated
in their heads, that all these operations are made
almost mechanically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the resources of France, the vivacity of her soldiers,
the intelligence of her officers, the national ambition,
the delicate sensibilities which they are known to
possess, had been applied to a system as well carried out,
we should have been then as much ahead of the Prussians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>as our army is at this moment inferior to theirs; and
that is much to say.</p>

<div id='i146'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i-146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>FREDERICK II.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I have seen also the Austrians, but not all assembled.
Their general system of economy should be more admired
than the man&oelig;uvres of their troops. Their method
is not simple; our regiments are better than theirs, and
such advantage as they could have in line over us, we
could with a little practice surpass them. I really believe
that there is no need for more instructions of
details in some of our best regiments than in those of
the Prussians; but their man&oelig;uvres are infinitely preferable
to ours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a week I dined with the Prussian king, his dinner
lasting three hours. The conversation was confined
to the Duke of York, the king, myself, and two or three
others, so that I had plenty of opportunity to listen to
him, and to admire the vivacity of his wit and the
charm of his graciousness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last I almost forgot he was a despot, selfish and
severe. Lord Cornwallis was there. The king placed
him next me at table, and on his other hand he had the
son of the king of England; then he asked a thousand
questions on American affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was surely a strange combination of circumstances
and of guests; but just this sort of ironical environments
would delight the sarcastic soul of the cunning
old warrior.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette had an equally strange experience in
America. During his campaign in Virginia, in an action
in which he was in command, General Phillips was
killed, and this general had been the officer who had
commanded the enemy’s troops at Minden when the
father of La Fayette was slain.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette met Cornwallis again in 1801, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>English lord came over to Paris to negotiate a general
peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>American independence having been secured, La Fayette’s
sympathies were aroused in behalf of the oppressed
African race. His soul abhorred injustice of any sort,
and when he met a wrong he always endeavored to aid in
righting it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not content himself with æsthetically expressing
his sympathy, but his enthusiasm always led him to
action. Whatsoever he did he entered into with his
whole might, and where there was wrong and oppression,
he felt himself called upon to devote his energies,
his position, and his purse in the cause of the oppressed.
So greatly was he moved in behalf of the negro slaves,
that he wrote to Washington soon after the American
war as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me, my dear General, now that you are about
to enjoy some repose, to propose a plan for elevating the
African race. Let us unite in purchasing a small estate
where we may try the experiment of freeing the negroes,
and use them only as tenants. Such an example as yours
would render the practice general; and if we should succeed
in America, I will cheerfully devote a part of my
time to render the plan fashionable in the West Indies.
If it be a wild scheme, I would rather be mad in that
way than be thought wise on the other tack.” Although
Washington, Adams, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, Patrick
Henry, and others cordially sympathized with him,
nothing definite was done except by the indefatigable
La Fayette himself. Not waiting for others, he purchased
a plantation in Cayenne, upon which were a large
number of slaves, and in order to prepare them for gradual
emancipation, he began to fit them for their freedom
by a thorough course of education.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Regarding this philanthropic act of La Fayette, his
daughter Virginie writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“An earnest wish to contribute to all that was good,
and a horror for all injustice, were prominent features in
my mother’s character. It was, therefore, with deep
satisfaction that she witnessed my father’s efforts in
favor of the abolition of the slave trade. He purchased
a plantation at Cayenne, La Belle Gabrielle, in order to
give the example of gradual emancipation. Every just
and liberal idea found a place in my mother’s heart, and
her active zeal made her seek ardently for every means
of putting them into immediate execution. My father
entrusted her with all the details of this undertaking, in
which the desire of teaching the negroes of that plantation
the first principles of religion and of morals was
united with the wish she shared with my father of making
them worthy of liberty. Her charity was excited
by the hope of teaching the blacks to know and love
God, and of proving to the free-thinkers who sympathized
with the negroes that the success of their undertaking
would be in great part due to religion. The events of
the Revolution have not allowed us to see these hopes
realized, but we have at least had the satisfaction of
hearing that the negroes of La Belle Gabrielle did not
commit the atrocities which were perpetrated in other
places.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding this philanthropic plan of La Fayette’s for
the uplifting of the negroes, Washington thus wrote to
him in 1786: “Your late purchase in Cayenne, with a
view of emancipating your slaves, is a generous and
noble proof of your humanity. Would to God a like
spirit might diffuse itself generally into the minds of
the people of this country! But I despair of seeing it.
Some petitions were presented to the Virginia Assembly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>at its last session for the abolition of slavery, but they
could scarcely obtain a hearing. To set the slaves afloat
at once would, I really believe, be productive of much inconvenience
and mischief; but by degrees it certainly
might, and assuredly ought, to be effected, and that, too,
by legislative authority.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette also interested himself at this time in
behalf of the persecuted French Protestants. Though
himself belonging to the Romish Church, he was neither
bigoted nor intolerant, and hated the tyranny of priests
as bitterly as the tyranny of kings.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of the sterner subjects regarding war and
politics, which form so large a part of the correspondence
between Washington and La Fayette, it may be pleasing
to note the following homely little incident which brings
both men in somewhat closer relationship with lesser
mortals whose lives are made up of petty details and
home affairs. In the “Mémoires et Manuscrits” of La
Fayette, a work published by his family, in Paris, in
1837, and which has never been entirely translated into
English, only scattered letters having been from time to
time culled therefrom, for the various sketches given regarding
the life of La Fayette, we have noticed much
valuable and interesting information not elsewhere to be
found.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the correspondence of General La Fayette
many letters from Washington were collected, several
of which were quoted in their proper chronological
order, and of the date of June, 1786, we find the following
little note, which is interesting, as it takes us into
the home-circle at Mount Vernon, and shows us the
goodly housewife in the person of Lady Washington,
and the kindly host rather than the stately general in this
picture of Washington. The note reads as follows:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Marquis</span>: You will be astonished to see
so ancient a date upon the letter which I send you, if I
did not say to you that the ship which was to have carried
this letter has since returned. Nothing new has
occurred since then, and I would not give you the weariness
of a second epistle, if I had not forgotten to say to
you that Madam Washington sends to Madame de La
Fayette a cask of ham. I know not if these are better,
or even as good, as those in France, but these are of our
own making, and you know that the ladies of Virginia
pride themselves upon the excellence of their ham, and
we remember that it was a dish much to your taste.
She has therefore desired that I offer them to you. I
had wished to send with them a barrel of old brandy
peaches, but I have not been able to procure enough of
good quality to be placed by the side of your luscious
wines, and so I send them not. After all, these two gifts
would be more proper to offer as a ration after a long
march in the rain than to figure upon your table in
Paris.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The Honorable Chauncey M. Depew, in his memorial
address, delivered at the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty
in New York Harbor, the gift of France to America,
thus ably comments upon the French alliance, and the
character of General La Fayette:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“The French alliance, which enabled us to win our
independence, is the romance of history. It overcame
improbabilities impossible in fiction, and its results surpass
the dreams of imagination. The most despotic of
kings, surrounded by the most exclusive of feudal aristocracies,
sending fleets and armies officered by the scions
of the proudest of nobilities to fight for subjects in revolt
and the liberties of the common people, is a paradox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>beyond the power of mere human energy to have wrought
or solved. The march of this mediæval chivalry across our
states, respecting persons and property as soldiers never
had before, never taking an apple or touching a fence-rail
without permission and payment, treating the ragged
Continentals as if they were knights in armor and of
noble ancestry, captivating our grandmothers by their
gallantry, and our grandfathers by their courage, remains
unequalled in the poetry of war. It is the most magnificent
tribute in history to the volcanic force of ideas and
the dynamitic power of truth, though the crust of the
globe imprison them. In the same ignorance and fearlessness
with which a savage plays about a powder magazine
with a torch, the Bourbon king and his court,
buttressed by the consent of centuries and the unquestioned
possession of every power to the state, sought
relief from cloying pleasures and vigor for enervated
minds in permitting and encouraging the loftiest genius
and the most impassioned eloquence of the time to discuss
the rights and liberties of man. With the orator
the themes were theories which fired only his imagination,
and with the courtiers they were pastimes or jests.
Neither speakers nor listeners saw any application of
these ennobling sentiments to the common mass and
grovelling herd whose industries they squandered in
riot and debauch, and whose bodies they hurled against
battlement and battery to gratify ambition or caprice.
But these revelations illuminated many an ingenuous
soul among the young aristocracy, and with distorted
rays penetrated the Cimmerian darkness which <a id='corr120.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='envelloped'>enveloped</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_120.30'><ins class='correction' title='envelloped'>enveloped</ins></a></span>
the people. They bore fruit in the heart and
mind of one youth, to whom America owes much, and
France everything,—the Marquis de La Fayette. As
the centuries roll by, and in the fulness of time the rays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of Liberty’s torch are the beacon lights of the world, the
central niches in the earth’s Pantheon of Freedom will
be filled by the figures of Washington and La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is idle now to speculate whether our fathers could
have succeeded without the French alliance. The struggle
would have been indefinitely prolonged and probably
compromised. But the alliance secured our triumph, and
La Fayette secured the alliance. The fabled argosies of
ancient, and the armadas and fleets of modern, times
were commonplace voyages compared with the mission
enshrined in this inspired boy. He who stood before the
Continental Congress and said, ‘I wish to serve you as
a volunteer, and without pay,’ and at twenty took his
place with Gates, and Green, and Lincoln as major-generals
in the Continental army. As a member of
Washington’s military family, sharing with that incomparable
man his board, and bed, and blanket, La Fayette
won his first and greatest distinction in receiving from
the American chief a friendship which was closer than
that bestowed upon any other of his compatriots, and
which ended only in death. The great commander saw
in the reckless daring with which he carried his wound
to rally the flying troops at Brandywine, the steady
nerve with which he held the column wavering under
a faithless general at Monmouth, the wisdom and caution
with which he man&oelig;uvred inferior forces in the face of
the enemy, his willingness to share every privation of
the illy-clad and starving soldiery, and to pledge his fortune
and credit to relieve their privations, a commander
upon whom he could rely, a patriot he could trust, a man
he could love.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga was the first
decisive event of the war. It defeated the British plan
to divide the country by a chain of forts up the Hudson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and conquer it in detail. It inspired hope at home and
confidence abroad. It seconded the passionate appeals
of La Fayette and the marvellous diplomacy of Benjamin
Franklin; it overcame the prudent counsels of Necker,
warning the king against this experiment; and won the
treaty of alliance between the old Monarchy and the
young Republic. La Fayette now saw that his mission
was in France. He said, ‘I can help the cause more at
home than here.’ and asked for leave of absence. Congress
voted him a sword and presented it with a resolution
of gratitude, and he returned, bearing this letter
from that convention of patriots to his king, ‘We
recommend this young nobleman to your Majesty’s
notice, as one whom we know to be wise in council,
gallant in the field, and patient under the hardships of
war.’ It was a certificate which Marlborough might
have coveted, and Gustavus might have worn as the
proudest of his decorations. But though king and
court vied with each other in doing him honor, though
he was welcomed as no Frenchman had ever been by
triumphal processions in the cities and fêtes in villages,
by addresses and popular applause, he reckoned them of
value only in the power they gave him to procure aid for
Liberty’s fight in America. ‘France is now committed
to war,’ he argued, ‘and her enemy’s weak point for
attack is in America. Send there your money and men.’
And he returned with the army of Rochambeau and the
fleet of De Grasse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is fortunate,’ said De Maurepas, the prime minister,
‘that La Fayette did not want to strip Versailles of
its furniture for his dear Americans, for nobody could
withstand his ardor.’ None too soon did this assistance
arrive, for Washington’s letter to the American commissioners
in Paris passed it on the way, in which he made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>this urgent appeal: ‘If France delays a timely and
powerful aid in the critical posture of our affairs, it will
avail us nothing should she attempt it hereafter. We
are at this hour suspended in the balance. In a word,
we are at the end of our tether, and now or never deliverance
must come.’ General Washington saw in the allied
forces now at his disposal that the triumph of independence
was assured. The long, dark night of doubt and
despair was illuminated by the dawn of a hope. The
material was at hand to carry out the comprehensive
plans so long matured, so long deferred, so patiently
kept. That majestic dignity which had never bent to
adversity, that lofty and awe-inspiring reserve which
presented an impenetrable barrier to familiarity, either
in council or at the festive board, so dissolved in the
welcome of these decisive visitors that the delighted
French and the astounded American soldiers saw Washington
for the first and only time in his life express his
happiness with all the joyous effervescence of hilarious
youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The flower of the young aristocracy of France, in
their brilliant uniforms, and the farmers and frontiersmen
of America, in their faded continentals, bound by a
common baptism of blood, became brothers in the knighthood
of liberty. With emulous eagerness to be in at the
death, while they shared the glory, they stormed the
redoubts at Yorktown, and compelled the surrender of
Cornwallis and army. While this practically ended the
war, it strengthened the alliance and cemented the friendship
between the two great peoples. The mutual confidence
and chivalric courtesy which characterized their
relations has no like example in international comity.
When an officer from General Carlton, the British commander-in-chief,
came to headquarters with an offer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>peace and independence, if the Americans would renounce
the French alliance, Washington refused to receive him;
Congress spurned Carlton’s secretary bearing a like message;
and the states, led by Maryland, denounced all
who entertained propositions of peace which were not
approved by France as public enemies. And peace with
independence meant prosperity and happiness to a people
in the very depths of poverty and despair. France, on
the other hand, though sorely pressed for money, said,
in the romantic spirit which permeated this wonderful
union: ‘Of the 27,000,000 livres we have loaned you,
we forgive you 9,000,000 as a gift of friendship, and
when with years there comes prosperity, you can pay the
balance without interest.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“With the fall of Yorktown La Fayette felt that
he could do more for peace and independence in the
diplomacy of Europe than in the war in America. His
arrival in France shook the continent. Though one of
the most practical and self-poised of men, his romantic
career in the New World had captivated courts and peoples.
In the formidable league which he had quickly
formed with Spain and France, England saw humiliation
and defeat, and made a treaty of peace by which she
recognized the independence of the Republic of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fight for liberty in America was won. Its future
here was threatened with but one danger,—the slavery
of the negro. The soul of La Fayette, purified by battle
and suffering, saw the inconsistency and the peril, and he
returned to this country to plead with state legislatures
and with Congress for the liberation of what he termed
‘my brethren, the blacks.’ But now the hundred years’
war for liberty in France was to begin. America was its
inspiration, La Fayette its apostle, and the returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>French army its emissaries. Beneath the trees by day
and in the halls at night, at Mount Vernon, La Fayette
gathered from Washington the gospel of freedom. It
was to sustain and guide him in after years against the
temptations of power and the despair of the dungeon.
He carried the lessons and the grand example through
all the trials and tribulations of his desperate struggle
and partial victory for the enfranchisement of his country.
From the ship, on departing, he wrote to his great
chief, whom he was never to see again, this touching
good by: ‘You are the most beloved of all the friends
I ever had or shall have anywhere. I regret that I cannot
have the inexpressible pleasure of embracing you in
my own house, and welcoming you in a family where
your name is adored. Everything that admiration, respect,
gratitude, friendship, and filial love can inspire is
combined in my affectionate heart to devote me most
tenderly to you. In your friendship I find a delight
which no words can express.’ His farewell to Congress
was a trumpet blast which resounded round a world then
bound in the chains of despotism and caste. Every government
on the continent was an absolute monarchy, and
no language can describe the poverty and wretchedness
of the people. Taxes levied without law exhausted their
property; they were arrested without warrant, and rotted
in the Bastile without trial, and they were shot as game,
and tortured without redress, at the caprice or pleasure
of their feudal lords. Into court and camp this message
came like the handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar’s
feast. Hear his words: ‘May this immense temple of
freedom ever stand a lesson to oppressors, an example to
the oppressed, a sanctuary for the rights of mankind, and
may these happy United States attain that complete
splendor and prosperity which will illustrate the blessings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of their government, and for ages to come rejoice
the departed souls of its founders.’ Well might Louis
the Sixteenth, more far-sighted than his ministers, exclaim,
‘After fourteen hundred years of power the old
monarchy is doomed.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is liberty without wisdom and without virtue? It is the
greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness, without
tuition or restraint.”—<span class='sc'>Burke.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>PARIS ran red with blood. The ghastly knife of
the guillotine fell incessantly. The terrible tocsin
sounded forth its ominous knell under the black midnight
sky, and clanged its harsh and horrid discords in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the midst of the summer’s stillness, and the glowing
brightness of midday. Why were these demons of
chaotic riot let loose upon the doomed city? Why
had men, and even women, become like wild beasts,
thirsting only for blood? Ah! there had gone forth
unheeded another wail, before the <em>awful</em> cry of <em>Blood!
Blood! Blood!</em> rang through the land. From the homes
of twenty-five millions of people had ascended the pitiful
appeal for <em>Bread! Bread! Bread!</em> And they had been
answered only by the exasperating spectacle of gorgeous
banquets, spread in the splendid <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>salons</em></span> of Versailles,
where the weak-minded king and the selfish, shortsighted
nobles surfeited themselves with luxuries, while
the people died of starvation unheeded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the price of bread?” asked a stranger of a
workingman’s wife. “Three francs twelve sous the quartern,”
was the answer. “The price is fixed at twelve sous,
but it is not to be had. My husband is obliged to pass
a whole day at the door of the baker. He loses his
wages of three francs; so that the bread comes to three
francs twelve sous the quartern.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But soon it rises to fourteen sous. “A brisk business
is doing on the bridges, in the open places, where men
passing with a loaf of bread under their arms re-sell it
to the workmen for twenty sous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We want powder for our wigs,” Jean Jacques Rousseau
had said; “that is the reason of the poor wanting
bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the reproach touches the hearts of actresses and
fashionable ladies; they discard powder, or use as little
as possible: the starch-makers are ordered to employ
barley instead of wheat; the pupils of the college Louis
le Grand resolve to eat rice, and to offer twenty-eight
sacks of wheat. The king forbids the playing of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>fountains at the fêtes, in order to turn the water to the
Versailles mills; but it is of no use: the associates of the
grain monopoly, the makers of the vile Famine Pact,
cause a fictitious scarcity by having the markets pillaged,
the mills burned, the corn thrown into the river
by a band of ruffians. Poor Louis is astonished, and begins
to doubt whether he is really king of France.” But
there were other causes back of the famine which led
to the volcanic outburst of the French Revolution. For
long years the terrible mine had been preparing beneath
the French monarchy, and at length exploded with awful
destruction and blood-curdling horrors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dazzling glory of the gorgeous Louis XVI., with
all its power and grandeur, was reared over a sleeping
volcano, destined to shock the continent of Europe,
when at length its slow fires should unite their direful
forces for the last mighty eruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>The glorious success of the American Revolution
inspired suffering people in all lands with a clearer hope
of future freedom. Regarding its effect upon France a
writer says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is difficult to suppose that so many thousand officers
and soldiers had visited America, and fought in
behalf of her rights, without being imbued with something
of a kindred spirit. There they beheld a new and
happy nation, among whom the pride of birth and the
distinctions of rank were alike unknown; there they
for the first time saw virtue and talents and courage
rewarded; there they viewed with surprise a sovereign
people fighting, not for a master, but themselves, and
haranguing, deliberating, dispensing justice, and administering
the laws, by representatives of their own free
choice. On their return the contrast was odious and
intolerable; they beheld family preferred to merit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>influence to justice, wealth to worth; they began to
examine into a constitution in which the monarch, whom
they were now accustomed to consider as only the first
magistrate, was everything, and the people, the fountain
of all power, merely ciphers; and they may well be supposed
to have wished, and even languished, for a change.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In fine, the people being left entirely destitute of
redress or protection, the royal authority paramount
and unbounded; the laws venal, the peasantry oppressed;
agriculture in a languishing state, commerce considered
as degrading; the public revenues farmed out to greedy
financiers; the public money consumed by a court wallowing
in luxury; and every institution at variance with
justice, policy, and reason,—a change became inevitable
in the ordinary course of human events; and, like all
sudden alterations in corrupt states, was accompanied
with the temporary evils and crimes that made many
good men look back on the ancient despotism with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it was not, however, the influence of the officers
and soldiers fresh from the field of American liberty
which gave the most fatal blow to the dynasty of the
Bourbons. The wanton and reckless extravagance of
past courts, culminating in the splendid lustre of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Le
Grand Monarque</em></span>, whose dazzling genius and rod of iron
won shouts of enthusiastic admiration, even amid the
groans of oppression, but whose gorgeous state could be
maintained only at the expense of his people’s degradation
and bondage, followed by the disreputable court
of the despicable Louis XV., had brought the public
finances to a condition of chaotic ruin. The annual
deficit amounted to millions; and when poor, weak, good-natured
Louis XVI. ascended the throne, it was even
then tottering upon the edge of the awful abyss, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>soon engulfed king and nation in its black and baleful
horrors.... When the fearful gulf became visible
to Louis XVI. and his cabinet, they looked around
despairingly for some means of escape. Maurepas, Turgot,
M. de Clugny, and Necker have each tried to stay
the coming of the direful doom, but each and all have
failed. And now M. de Calonne becomes comptroller-general.
Now surely the royal inmates of the &OElig;il-de-B&oelig;uf
may breathe more freely. Obstacles seem for a
while to flee away before this incomparable comptroller-general.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fear this is a matter of difficulty,” said her Majesty,
Queen Marie Antoinette.—“Madame,” replied the comptroller,
“if it is but difficult, it is done; if it is impossible,
it shall be done.” Truly most admirable was
such an all-conquering comptroller-general!</p>

<p class='c010'>But deficits will not be removed by promises, however
prodigal of wind and words, and royal deficits of millions
form too wide an abyss for even this boastful
comptroller to bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we cannot cross this yawning gulf at a leap, what
shall we do?” ask king and nobles of their pet Calonne.
“We must hold a <em>Convocation of the Notables</em>,” replies
the intrepid comptroller-general.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so the Assembly of the Notables was convened
by royal proclamation, and on the 22d of February, 1787,
La Fayette, who had been chosen a member from his
province, took his seat with his associates in this
memorable gathering.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now the dreadful secret must be revealed; these
titled notables must be conducted to the edge of this
terrifying precipice, and made to gaze into the black
depths of the financial chasm. Consternation blanches
the cheeks of these assembled lords; but the courage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>La Fayette is not extinguished, nor his love of liberty
impaired, nor his bold spirit benumbed by evils however
monstrous, or difficulties however defiant. To right the
wrong is ever his aim, and to remove the root of error is
always his persevering endeavor. Back of the ruinous
deficit of millions is a still deeper abyss of evil, into
which the brave soul of La Fayette courageously gazes;
and though startled at the infamous disclosures of corruption,
injustice, bitter abuses, and shameful oppressions,
he is not appalled, but in the face of king and
nobles he rises chivalrously as the people’s champion,
and demands redress. Though a brother of the king is
president of this council, though he must protest
against both monarch and court, with dignified firmness
he fearlessly exclaims: “I repeat with renewed confidence
the remark that the millions which are dissipated
are collected by taxation, and that taxation can only be
justified by the real wants of the state; that the millions
abandoned to peculation or avarice are the fruits of
the labor, the tears, and perhaps the blood of the
people, and that the computation of unfortunate individuals,
which has been made for the purpose of
realizing sums so heedlessly squandered, affords a frightful
subject of consideration for the justice and goodness
which, we feel convinced, are the natural sentiments of
his Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But La Fayette stood alone as the upholder of the
people’s rights; the principles of liberty which he thus
boldly declared were received with horrified amazement
by the old aristocracy, and the heart of the weak monarch
was filled with strange foreboding. Before the
Assembly closed its session, the heroic words of La Fayette
had begun to work their brave mission. Threats of
danger reached his ears; but his eye did not quail; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>was not awed into silence. His enemies proposed to the
king that he should be sent to the Bastile; but their
menaces were only received with a smile by La Fayette,
who dauntlessly continued his efforts in behalf of the
down-trodden people.</p>

<p>ASSEMBLY OF THE NOTABLES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The following letter from La Fayette to Washington
will give a clearer insight regarding the opinions of the
marquis upon public affairs:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Paris</span>, May 25, 1788.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: In the midst of our internal
troubles it is a great consolation for me to enjoy the
assured prosperity of my adopted country, because the
news from America gives me the hope that the constitution
will be accepted. Permit me once more, my dear
General, to beseech you not to refuse the presidency.
The constitution, such as is proposed, responds to many
desires; but I fear there are, regarding it, certain passages
which will not be completed without danger, if the
United States have not the happiness of possessing their
guardian angel, who will appreciate the advantages and
disadvantages of each clause, and will be aware, before
re-entering his quiet retreat, how to determine with precision
the degree of force which it is indispensable to
give the government, and to limit those powers which
one might abuse; in short, to indicate that which remains
to be done, in order to attain that perfection to
which the new constitution is nearer than that of any
other form of government, past or present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The affairs of France are reaching a crisis, of which
the good results are most uncertain, as the people in general
have no inclination to come to extremities. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mourir
pour la liberté</em></span> is not the motto upon this side of the
Atlantic; as all the classes are more or less dependent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>as the rich love their repose, at the same time that the
poor are enervated by misery and ignorance, we have
but one resource: it is to reason with them, and to
inspire the nation with a sort of passive discontent, or
non-obedience which will fatigue the levity and baffle
the plans of government.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Parliaments, in spite of their inefficiency, have
been the necessary champions to move. You will see by
the publications—because I have sent you all which have
appeared—that the king has raised pretensions, and that
the courts of justice are established upon principles so
contradictory, that one can scarcely believe that these
assertions have been declared in the same country and
in the same age. Affairs cannot remain thus; the government
has employed the force of arms against the disarmed
and expelled magistrates. And the people, say
you?—The people, my dear General, have been so benumbed
that it has made me sick, and medicines have
been necessary to cool my blood. That which has greatly
increased my indignation is a bench of justice where the
king has created a plenary court composed of judges, of
peers, and of courtiers, without a single real representative
of the people, and the impudence of the ministers
who have dared to say that all the taxes and loans will
be registered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks to God, we have prevailed against them, and
I begin to hope for a constitution. The magistrates
have refused to sit in the plenary courts. The thirty-eight
peers, of whom a small number have some sense
and some courage, will not obey. Some of them, such
as my friend La Rochefoucauld, conduct themselves
nobly; the others follow at a distance. The Parliaments
have unanimously protested, and made an appeal
to the nation. The greater part of the inferior courts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>represent the new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>régime</em></span>. Discontent is displayed
everywhere, and in several provinces has not been repressed.
The clergy who find themselves assembled at
this time make remonstrances; the advocates refuse to
plead; the government is embarrassed, and begins to
resort to apologies; the governors in some cities have
been pelted by stones and mud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the midst of these troubles and of this anarchy
the friends of liberty fortify themselves daily, close the
ear to all negotiations, and declare that they will have a
National Assembly or nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such, my dear General, is our present situation.
For my part, I shall be satisfied to think that, after
a little, I shall be in an assembly of the representatives
of the French nation, or at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so absorbed by these affairs that I will say
little to you upon European politics. My disapprobation
of the projects of the administration, and the small
attempts I have made against it, have forced me to discontinue
to see the archbishop; but I become more
united to him and to the keeper of the seals, the more
I have made clear my indignation against the infernal
plan. I am well pleased that the decree regarding
America was passed before these troubles, and I occupy
myself, through other ministers, in endeavoring to suppress
totally the duties upon oil and whalebone, so
that the French and American negotiations will be
placed upon a basis of equality, even under the revenue
premiums, and that without obliging the fishermen to
leave the coasts of their country. If we become reunited,
it will be necessary to consider immediately the
commerce with the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am happy that we have here M. Jefferson for an
ambassador; his talents, his virtues, his excellent character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>all constitute a great statesman, a zealous citizen,
and a precious friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pray you, my dear General, to receive my tender
homages, etc.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Regarding Washington’s feelings in view of accepting
the presidency, the following lines to La Fayette upon
that subject will not be without interest. They were
written in answer to La Fayette’s ardently expressed
hopes that his revered commander-in-chief would not
refuse the important office which the needs of his country
forced upon him. The letter was written in 1788.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have but a few things, nothing new, except to
respond to the opinion which you have already expressed.
You think that it will be expedient to accept
the office of which you speak; your sentiments are more
in accordance with those of my other friends than with
mine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In truth, the difficulties appear to me to multiply and
increase in approaching the period when in accordance
with the general belief it will be necessary to give a
definite response. In case the circumstances should in
some sort force upon me my acceptance, be assured, my
dear sir, that I accept the burden with sincere reluctance
and with great self-distrust—that which will probably
be little credited by the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I know well the bottom of my heart, the conviction
that I fulfil a duty will alone determine me to
resume an active part in public affairs; at that time I
shall endeavor to form a plan of conduct, and at the risk
of losing my past reputation and my present popularity;
I will work without respite to remove my fellow-citizens
from the difficult situation where they find themselves,
in need of credit; and to establish a system of politics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>which, if it will be followed, will insure their future
power and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I perceive a ray of light illuminating the
way which leads to that end. The present state of
affairs and the tendency of public opinion give me the
hope that there will result union, honesty, industry, and
frugality—those four pillars of public felicity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But this encouraging picture of American affairs was
offset by direful scenes in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>Feeling that justice demanded that if the people were
to be taxed they should be represented, La Fayette
offered to the Assembly a memorial for the king, in
which he entreated his Majesty to convoke a <em>National</em>
Assembly, which might accomplish the regeneration of
France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, sir!” exclaimed the President of the Council,
starting from his seat in astonishment; “do you ask for
the convocation of the States-General?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my lord, and even more than that,” was La Fayette’s
dauntless reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You wish me then to write and announce to the king
that the Marquis de La Fayette moves to convoke the
States-General?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my lord,” calmly answered the marquis.</p>

<p class='c010'>This daring proposition appalled the Notables, but was
hailed with shouts of acclamation by the public. The
States-General was first convoked by Philippe le Bel, in
1303, and had only rarely assembled since that time.
The despotic governments looked upon this institution
with abhorrence, for in it the common people were represented.
It was composed of the three estates of the
kingdom,—the nobles, the clergy, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span>, or common
people,—and Louis and his court were determined if
possible to avoid this dreaded Assembly. But the shout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>rang out from every quarter of France, in answer to the
clarion bugle note which La Fayette had so bravely
sounded even in the very midst of the enemy’s camp.
“Give us the States-General!” From the Alps and the
Pyrenees, the shores of the Mediterranean, and the borders
of the Channel, was re-echoed the wild cry, “Give
us the States-General!” And Louis, unable to resist
the raging tempest of popular opinion, yielded to their
demand, and the States-General was by royal edict convened
on the 5th of May, 1789.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was chosen a deputy by the nobility of
Auvergne. To say “let States-General be” was easy;
to say in what manner they shall be is not so easy.
“How to shape the States-General? There is a problem.
Each body corporate, each privileged, each organized
class, has secret hopes of its own in that matter, and also
secret misgivings of its own; for, behold, this monstrous
twenty-million class, hitherto the dumb sheep
which these others had to agree about the manner of
shearing, is now also arising with hopes! It has ceased
or is ceasing to be dumb; it speaks through pamphlets,
or at least brays and growls behind them, in unison,
increasing wonderfully their volume of sound. <em>What is
the third estate? What has it hitherto been in our form of
government? Nothing. What does it want? To become
something.</em>” These are questions and answers which
must now be met. The Assembly was opened with great
pomp. A solemn procession in which king, nobles,
clergy, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span> all repaired in grand state to
Notre Dame, paraded through the streets, and formed a
splendid spectacle which was greeted by the people with
joyous demonstrations and loud acclamations.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first meeting of the Assembly, the three orders
convened in separate departments. Here arose the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>difficulty. The nobles and the clergy were unwilling to
meet with the representatives of the common people, and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span> were determined to maintain their contested
rights. La Fayette advocated the cause of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span>
in the assembly of the nobles, but the aristocracy would
not yield, and at the end of five weeks the States-General
as a united body was still inactive. At length the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers
état</em></span> resolved upon momentous action. They formed themselves
into a legislative body, under the name of the
National Assembly, and declared their intention to accomplish
political reform. The king and nobles received
this unexpected news with consternation. La Fayette
warmly urged a union between the departments, but the
king and aristocracy refused. Louis then determined to
awe these rebellious subjects to submission. He ordered
the doors of the hall where the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span> usually met to
be closed and guarded. When the members gathered
and found their usual place of meeting denied them, they
proceeded to another, and thereupon issued their defiant
demand,—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>A Constitution for the French People</em></span>; and they
solemnly declared with oath, in view of the indignity
which had been offered to them by the crown, “never to
separate, and to assemble whenever circumstances should
require, till the constitution of the kingdom should be
established and founded on a solid basis.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At length, on the 23d of June, the king and nobles assembled
in the hall formerly occupied by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tiers état</em></span>,
and after some delay the doors were opened to that body,
and the king reproached them for taking the title of
National Assembly, and bade them renounce it, and also
commanded that the Assembly should immediately separate.
The king then left the hall, followed by the nobles
and part of the clergy. But scarcely had the sound of
the footsteps of royalty died away ere a man arose in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the Assembly. It was Mirabeau. With eyes flashing
like stars from the gloomy shadows of his pock-marked,
disfigured countenance, he exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“What means this insulting dictation? this threatening
display of arms? this flagrant violation of the
national temple? Who is it that dictates to you the
way in which you shall be happy? He who acts by
your commission. Who is it that gives you imperious
laws? He who acts by your commission,—the minister,
who by your appointment is vested with the execution
of the laws,—of laws which we only have a right
to make.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To us, twenty-five millions of people are looking to
guard from further desecration the sacred ark of liberty,
to release them from the burdensome yoke which has so
long crushed them, and to give them back their own inalienable
right to peace, liberty, and happiness. Gentlemen,
an attempt is made to destroy the freedom of your
deliberations. The iron chain of despotic proscription is
laid upon you. A military force surrounds your Assembly.
Where are the enemies of France? Is Catiline
at our gates? Gentlemen! I demand that, clothing
yourself in your dignity and your legislative authority,
you remain firm in the sacredness of your oath, which
does not permit us to separate till we have framed a
constitution—till we have given a <em>Magna Charta</em> to
France.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then as the grand master of ceremonies again reminded
the Assembly of the commands of the king, Mirabeau exclaimed,
“Go and tell your master that we are here by
the order of the people, and that we shall depart only at
the point of the bayonet.”</p>

<div id='i176'  class='figcenter id014'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“GO AND TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE BY THE ORDER OF THE PEOPLE.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette, with the forty-seven who had stood by his
side in declaring the expediency of uniting with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>commons, now left the nobility, and took his seat in the
National Assembly. The king and aristocracy, finding
at length that their resistance was useless, submitted to
the popular demand, and on the 27th of June the three
orders met together and commenced their united deliberations.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was closely observed by all parties. He
spoke often in the Assembly, and always on the side of
freedom. On the 11th of July he brought forward his
famous Declaration of Rights; which after a long and
stormy debate, during which it was warmly supported by
the republicans, and denounced by the adherents of despotism,
was adopted; and the name of La Fayette, “THE
PEOPLE’S FRIEND!” was on every lip and enshrined
in every heart throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>This renowned Declaration of Rights reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nature has made all men free and equal; the distinctions
which are necessary for social order are founded
alone on the public good.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Man is born with inalienable and imprescriptible rights,
such as the unshackled liberty of opinion, the care of his
honor and life, the right of property, the complete control
over his person, his industry, and all his faculties;
the free expression of his opinion in every possible manner;
the worship of the Almighty; and resistance against
oppression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The exercise of natural rights has no other limits
than those which are necessary to secure their enjoyment
to every member of society.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No man can be made subject to laws which he has
not sanctioned, either himself, or through his representatives,
and which have not been properly promulgated
and legally executed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The principle of all sovereignty rests in the people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>No body or individual can possess any authority which
does not expressly emanate from the nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sole end of all government is the public good.
That good demands that the legislative, executive, and
judicial powers should be distinct and defined, and that
their organization should secure the free representation
of the citizens, the responsibility of their deputies, and
the impartiality of the judges.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The laws ought to be clear, precise, and uniform in
their operation toward every class of citizens.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Subsidies ought to be liberally granted and the taxes
proportionally distributed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And as the introduction of abuses and the rights of
succeeding generations will require the revisions of all
human institutions, the nation ought to possess the power,
in certain cases, to summon an extraordinary assembly
of deputies, whose sole object shall be to examine and
correct, if it be necessary, the faults of the constitution.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 14th of July a riotous crowd march to the Invalides,
and having armed themselves with the twenty-eight
thousand muskets found there, and dragging twenty
cannon, they proceed to storm the Bastile. After five
hours the Bastile is taken by the people, and the Revolution,
which might perhaps have been stayed by different
measures on the part of the government, is henceforth
destined to work out its direful doings.</p>

<p>THE CROWD ARM THEMSELVES FROM THE INVALIDES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The National Guard, composed of citizens rather than
mercenary soldiers, was now formed, and La Fayette was
entrusted with the command. The key of the demolished
Bastile was given to him, as the most worthy person to
receive this memorial of past oppression. La Fayette
was now looked up to by the people as their defender,
and the masses gave him warm but fickle homage.
Toulongeon says of him: “La Fayette, whose name and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>reputation acquired in America were associated with
liberty itself, was at the head of the Parisian National
Guard. He enjoyed at once that entire confidence and
public esteem which are due to great qualities. The
faculty of raising the spirits, or rather of infusing fresh
courage into the heart, was natural to him. His external
appearance was youthful and bold, which is always pleasing
to the multitude. His manners were simple, popular,
and engaging. He possessed everything which is wanting
to commence and terminate a revolution,—the brilliant
qualities of military activity and the calm confidence
of courage in times of public commotion. La Fayette
was equal to everything, if everything had been done
fairly and openly; but he was unacquainted with the
dark and narrow road of intrigue.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s idea of liberty was always accompanied
with a firm belief in law and order; it was not the liberty
of unbridled license. When he first upheld the
Revolution in France, it was with the same spirit with
which he had aided the American Revolution, contending
only for liberty and order; and when, during the
Reign of Terror, riot and license held the reins of power,
then La Fayette was to be found not in sympathy with
this wild, reckless turmoil, but always standing by the
recognized government, though that government were
even a monarchy, and risking his own life to save those
royal lives, who so poorly repaid his generous and
chivalrous devotion as even to turn with contemptuous
coldness toward him who had sacrificed his own popularity
to save them from destruction.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the head of the National Guard La Fayette had a
most difficult task to perform during those days of riotous
commotion. His sympathies were with the oppressed
people; his duty was to maintain public order; his loyalty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>made him true to his king. When the unfortunate
minister Foulon was seized by the mob and dragged before
the Assembly, where the rioters clamored loudly
for his death, La Fayette thus appealed to the furious
crowd:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am known to you all; you have appointed me your
commander,—a station which, while it confers honor,
imposes upon me the duty of speaking to you with that
liberty and candor which form the basis of my character.
You wish, without a trial, to put to death the man who
is before you; such an act of injustice would dishonor
you; it would disgrace me; and were I weak enough to
permit it, it would blast all the efforts which I have
made in favor of liberty. I will not permit it. I am
far from desiring to save him, if he be guilty; I only
wish that the orders of the Assembly should be carried
into execution, and that this man be conducted to prison,
to be judged by a legal tribunal. I wish the law to be
respected; law, without which there can be no liberty;
law, without whose aid I would never have contributed
to the revolution of the New World, and without which I
will not contribute to the revolution which is preparing
here. What I advance in favor of the forms of law
ought not to be interpreted in favor of M. Foulon. But
the greater the presumption of his guilt is, the more important
is it that the usual formalities should be observed
in his case, so as to render his punishment more striking,
and by legal examinations, to discover his accomplices.
I therefore command that he be conducted to the prison
of L’Abbaye St. Germain.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>VIEW OF THE BASTILE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>These remarks were hailed with applause by those
within hearing of them; but at this moment a fresh mob
broke into the Assembly, and set up a furious yell for
vengeance; and notwithstanding the loud intercessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of La Fayette, deaf to everything but their wild fury,
the rioters seized the hated Foulon, and rushing forth,
hanged him to a lamp post in front of the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p class='c010'>Liberty and law may both be spoken almost synonymously
with the name of La Fayette. His abhorrence
of such lawless acts of vengeance was as strong as his
zeal for freedom. Horrified at the lawlessness of the
populace, and feeling that his honor was thereby jeopardized,
La Fayette determined to resign his office as commander-in-chief
of the National Guard, which he did in
the following letter addressed to the mayor of Paris:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: Summoned by the confidence of its citizens to
the military command of the capital, I have uniformly
declared that in the present state of affairs it was necessary,
to be useful, that confidence should be full and
universal. I have steadily declared to the people that,
although devoted to their interest to my last breath, yet
I was incapable of purchasing their favor by unjustly
yielding to their wishes. You are aware, sir, that one
of the individuals who perished yesterday was placed
under a guard, and that the other was under the escort
of our troops, both being sentenced by the civil power to
undergo a regular trial. Such were the proper means to
satisfy justice, to discover their accomplices, and to fulfil
the solemn engagements of every citizen toward the
National Assembly and the king.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The people would not hearken to my advice; and the
moment when the confidence which they promised, and
reposed in me, is lost, it becomes my duty, as I have before
stated, to abandon a post in which I can no longer
be useful. I am, with respect,</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>The news of La Fayette’s resignation spread consternation
throughout the city. The National Guard flocked
around him to beseech him to retain his position as their
commander. The mayor and council waited upon him at
midnight, to solicit him to withdraw his resignation. But
La Fayette calmly declined, and the next day appeared
before the Assembly to state his reasons for so doing, in
the following dignified and courteous terms:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen, I come to acknowledge the last testimonies
of your kindness with all the warmth of a heart
whose first desire, after that of serving the people, is to
be loved by them, and to express my astonishment at the
importance they deign to attach to an individual, in a
free country, where nothing should be of real importance
except law. If my conduct on this occasion could be
regulated by my sentiments of gratitude and affection, I
should only reply to the regrets with which you and the
National Guard had honored me by yielding obedience
to your entreaties; but, as I was guided by no feeling of
private interest when I formed that resolution, so also, in
the midst of the various causes for agitation that surround
us, I cannot allow myself to be governed by my
private affections.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen, when I received such touching proofs of
affection, too much was done for me and too little for the
<em>law</em>. I am convinced how well my comrades love <em>me</em>, but
I am still ignorant to what degree they cherish the principles
on which liberty is founded. Deign to make known
to the National Guard this sincere avowal of my sentiments.
To command them, it is necessary that I should
feel certain that they unanimously believe that the fate
of the constitution depends upon the execution of law,
the only sovereign of a free people; that individual
liberty, the security of each man’s home, religious liberty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and respect for legitimate authority, are duties as sacred
to them as to myself. We require not only courage and
vigilance, but unanimity, in these principles; and I
thought, and still think, that the constitution will be
better served by my resignation, on the grounds I have
given, than by my acquiescence in the request with which
you have deigned to honor me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The National Guards were already assembled, impatiently
awaiting La Fayette’s answer; and upon receiving
this decision, they immediately passed the following
resolution:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“The National Assembly has decreed that the public forces
should be obedient, and a portion of the Parisian army has
shown itself essentially disobedient. General La Fayette has
only ceased to command that army because they have ceased to
obey law. He requires a complete submission to the law, not
a servile attachment to his person. Let the battalions assemble.
Let each citizen-soldier swear on his word and honor to obey
the law. Let those who refuse be excluded from the National
Guards. Let the wish of the army, thus regenerated, be carried
to General La Fayette, and he will conceive it his duty to resume
command.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>After some hesitation La Fayette resolved to resume
his command, and withdrew his resignation. His desires
were only for the public good. When urged by the municipality
of Paris to accept some remuneration for his services,
he unselfishly replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My private fortune secures me from want. It has
outlasted two revolutions; and should it survive a third,
through the complaisance of the people, it shall belong
to them alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mirabeau said of La Fayette: “There is one man in
the state who, from his position, is exposed to the hazard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of all events; to whom successes can offer no compensation
for reverses; and who is, in some manner, answerable
for the repose, we may even say the safety, of the
public,—and that man is La Fayette.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But La Fayette was not superhuman. His arm could
not turn backward the awful Juggernaut of the oncoming
revolution. The corruption and oppression of
past centuries could not be wiped out by the untarnished
purity of life and principles of this self-sacrificing Knight
of Liberty. And beneath the bloody wheels of the huge
Juggernaut of license,—law, liberty, and La Fayette
were all to be ruthlessly sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sword of Damocles hung suspended over the head
of the unfortunate king, and the throne was tottering,
soon to be engulfed in hopeless ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the morning of the 5th of October, a woman, frenzied
with hunger, rushed into a guard-house, and seizing
a drum, ran with it along the streets, accompanying her
wild beating with the frantic cry of “Bread! bread!”
As the crowd increases, every voice takes up the shrill
shriek for bread, until at last the mad chorus changes to
a furious clamor, and the words “To Versailles!” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>A
Versailles!</em></span>“ ring out in hoarse yells from street to street,
and the alarm bell sounds the direful tocsin which sends
a knell of despair to every listener’s heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news of the riot reaches La Fayette, and he says:
“As soon as the tidings reached me, I instantly perceived
that, whatever might be the consequence of this movement,
the public safety required that I should take part
in it, and after having received from the Hôtel de Ville
an order and two commissaries, I hastily provided for the
security of Paris, and took the road to Versailles, at the
head of several battalions.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE CROWD SHOUT, “TO VERSAILLES.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Alarmed lest the Guard themselves might be induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to join in the revolt, he halted on the way and made
every one renew his oath of fidelity to the king and
obedience to the law. A description of this momentous
march is nowhere so quaintly and so graphically told as
by Carlyle, who, in spite of certain sarcasms, seems to
appreciate La Fayette’s difficult position, and surely it
would seem as though only the grim irony of fate could
have placed this Knight of Liberty in the midst of such
lawless rioters: and yet, throughout all these trying circumstances,
La Fayette is not once inconsistent to his
avowed principles; and whether he sympathizes with
the people’s wrongs, or endeavors to shield his king from
their furious attacks, he is ever true to his principles of
right and honor.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so we will let Carlyle take La Fayette to Versailles
in his own inimitable way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Three Hundred have assembled; all the Committees
are in activity; Lafayette is dictating despatches
for Versailles, when a deputation of the Centre Grenadiers
introduces itself to him. The deputation makes
military obeisance; and thus speaks, not without a kind
of thought in it: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mon Général</em></span>, we are deputed by the
six companies of Grenadiers. We do not think you a
traitor, but we think the government betrays you; it is
time that this end. We cannot turn our bayonets against
women crying to us for bread. The people are miserable;
the source of the mischief is at Versailles; we must go
seek the king, and bring him to Paris. We must exterminate
[<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>exterminer</em></span>] the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Regiment de Flandre</em></span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Gardes-du-Corps</em></span>, who have dared to trample on the National
Cockade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘If the king be too weak to wear his crown, let him
lay it down. You will crown his son; you will name a
Council of Regency, and all will go better.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Reproachful astonishment paints itself on the face
of La Fayette, speaks itself from his eloquent chivalrous
lips in vain. ‘My General, we would shed the last drop
of our blood for you, but the root of the mischief is at
Versailles; we must go and bring the king to Paris; all
the people wish it’ (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tout le peuple le veut</em></span>).</p>

<p class='c010'>“My General descends to the outer staircase, and harangues
once more in vain. ‘To Versailles! To Versailles!’
Mayor Bailly, sent for through floods of
Sansculottism, attempts academic oratory from his gilt
state-coach, realizes nothing but infinite hoarse cries of,
‘Bread! To Versailles!’ and gladly shrinks within
doors. La Fayette mounts the white charger; and again
harangues and reharangues, with eloquence, with firmness,
indignant demonstration, with all things but persuasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>To Versailles! To Versailles!</em></span>’ so lasts it hour after
hour, for the space of half a day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The great Scipio-Americanus can do nothing; not so
much as escape. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Morbleu, mon Général!</em></span>’ cry the
Grenadiers, serrying their ranks as the white charger
makes a motion that way; ‘you will not leave us, you will
abide with us!’ A perilous juncture; Mayor Bailly and
the Municipals sit quaking within doors; My General is
prisoner without; the Place de Grève, with its thirty
thousand regulars, its whole irregular, Saint Antoine and
Saint Marceau, is one minatory mass of clear or rusty
steel; all hearts set, with a moody fixedness, on one
object. Moody, fixed are all hearts: tranquil is no
heart, if it be not that of the white charger, who paws
there with arched neck, composedly champing his bit, as
if no world, with its Dynasties and Eras, were now rushing
down. The drizzly day bends westward; the cry is
still, ‘To Versailles!’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Nay, now, borne from afar, come quite sinister cries;
hoarse, reverberating in long-drawn hollow murmurs,
with syllables too like those of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Lanterne!</em></span>’ Or else,
irregular Sansculottism may be marching off, of itself,
with pikes; nay, with cannon. The inflexible Scipio
does at length, by aide-de-camp, ask of the Municipals
whether or not he may go. A letter is handed out to
him, over armed heads; sixty thousand faces flash fixedly
on his; there is stillness, and no bosom breathes till
he has read. By Heaven, he grows suddenly pale! Do
the Municipals permit? ‘Permit, and even order,’ since
he can no other. Clangor of approval rends the welkin.
To your ranks, then; let us march!</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, as we compute, towards three in the afternoon.
Indignant National Guards may dine for once from their
haversacks; dined or undined, they march with one
heart. Paris flings up her windows, ‘claps hands,’ as the
Avengers with their shrilling drums and shalms tramp
by; she will then sit pensive, apprehensive, and pass
rather a sleepless night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the white charger, La Fayette, in the slowest
possible manner, going and coming, and eloquently haranguing
among the ranks, rolls onward with his thirty
thousand. Saint Antoine, with pike and cannon, has
preceded him; a mixed multitude of all and of no arms
hovers on his flanks and skirts; the country once more
pauses agape: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Paris marche sur nous</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Towards midnight lights flare on the hill; La Fayette’s
lights! The roll of his drums come up the Avenue
de Versailles. With peace or with war? Patience,
friends! With neither. La Fayette is come, but not
yet the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has halted and harangued so often on the march;
spent nine hours on four leagues of road. At Montreuil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>close on Versailles, the whole host had to pause, and,
with uplifted right hand in the murk of night, to these
pouring skies, swear solemnly to respect the king’s
dwelling, to be faithful to king and National Assembly.
Rage is driven down out of sight by the laggard march;
the thirst of vengeance slaked in weariness and soaking
clothes. Flandre is again drawn out under arms; but
Flandre grown so patriotic, now needs no ‘exterminating.’
The wayworn battalions halt in the Avenue; they
have, for the present, no wish so pressing as that of
shelter and rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anxious sits President Mounier; anxious the Château.
There is a message coming from the Château,
that M. Mounier would please to return thither with a
fresh deputation swiftly, and so at least <em>unite</em> our two
anxieties. Anxious Mounier does of himself send, meanwhile,
to appraise the general that his Majesty has been
so gracious as to grant us the acceptance pure and simple.
The general, with a small advance column, makes
answer in passing, speaks vaguely some smooth words to
the National President, glances only with the eye at
that so mixtiform National Assembly, then fares forward
towards the Château. There are with him two Paris
Municipals; they were chosen from the three hundred
for that errand. He gets admittance through the locked
and padlocked gates, through sentries and ushers, to the
royal halls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The court, male and female, crowds on his passage
to read their doom on his face, which exhibits, say historians,
a ‘mixture of sorrow, of fervor and valor,’ singular
to behold. The king, with Monsieur, with ministers
and marshals, is waiting to receive him. He ‘is come,’
in his highflown chivalrous way, ‘to offer his head for
the safety of his Majesty’s.’ The two Municipals state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the wish of Paris; four things of quite pacific tenor.
First, that the honor of guarding his sacred person be
conferred on patriot National Guards, say the Centre
Grenadiers, who as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Gardes Françaises</em></span> were wont to have
that privilege. Second, that provisions be got if possible.
Third, that the prisons, all crowded with political
delinquents, may have judges sent them. Fourth, <em>that
it would please his Majesty to come and live in Paris</em>. To
all which four wishes, except the fourth, his Majesty
answers readily Yes; or indeed may almost say that he
has already answered it. To the fourth he can answer
only Yes or No, would so gladly answer Yes <em>and</em> No!
But in any case, are not their dispositions, thank Heaven,
so entirely pacific? There is time for deliberation. The
brunt of the danger seems past.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette and D’Estaing settle the watches; Centre
Grenadiers are to take the guard-room, they of old occupied
as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Gardes Françaises</em></span>; for indeed the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Gardes-de-Corps</em></span>,
its late ill-advised occupants, are gone mostly to
Rambouillet. That is the order of <em>this</em> night; sufficient
for the night is the evil thereof. Whereupon La Fayette
and the two Municipals, with highflown chivalry take
their leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So brief has the interview been, Mounier and his
deputation were not yet got up. So brief and satisfactory,
a stone is rolled from every heart. The fair palace
dames publicly declare that this La Fayette, detestable
though he be, is their saviour for once. Even the ancient
vinaigrous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Tantes</em></span> admit it; the king’s aunts, ancient
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Graille</em></span> and Sisterhood, known to us of old. Queen
Marie Antoinette has been heard often to say the like.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Towards three in the morning all things are settled;
the watches set, the Centre Grenadiers put into their old
guard-room, and harangued; the Swiss and few remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>body-guard harangued. The wayworn Paris battalions,
consigned to the hospitality of Versailles, lie
dormant in spare beds, spare barracks, coffee-houses,
empty churches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The troublous day has brawled itself to rest; no
lives yet lost but that of one war-horse. Insurrectionary
Chaos lies slumbering round the palace like ocean round
a diving-bell,—no crevice yet disclosing itself. Deep
sleep has fallen promiscuously on the high and on the
low, suspending most things, even wrath and famine.
Darkness covers the earth. But, far on the northeast,
Paris flings up her great yellow gleam far into the wet,
black night. For all is illuminated there, as in the old
July nights; the streets deserted, for alarm of war; the
municipals all wakeful; patrols hailing with their hoarse
<em>Who goes?</em></p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette, in the <a id='corr154.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Hotel'>Hôtel</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_154.17'><ins class='correction' title='Hotel'>Hôtel</ins></a></span> de Nôailles, not far from
the Château, having now finished haranguing, sits with
his officers, consulting. At five o’clock the unanimous
best counsel is, that a man so tossed and toiled for
twenty-four hours and more, fling himself on a bed and
seek some rest....</p>

<p class='c010'>“The dull dawn of a new morning, drizzly and chill,
had but broken over Versailles. Rascality is in the
Grand Court.... Barricading serves not; fly fast, ye
body-guards: rabid Insurrection, like the hell-bound
chase, uproaring at your heels.... ‘Save the Queen!’
Tremble not, women, but haste, for, lo! another voice
shouts far through the outermost door, ‘Save the
Queen!’ It is brave Miomandre’s voice that shouts
this second warning. He has stormed across imminent
death to do it; fronts imminent death, having done it....</p>

<p class='c010'>“Trembling maids-of-honor hastily wrap the queen, not
in robes of state. She flies for her life across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>&OElig;il-de-B&oelig;uf</em></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>against the main door of which, too, Insurrection
batters. She is in the king’s apartment, in the
king’s arms; she clasps her children amid a faithful few.
The imperial-hearted bursts into mother’s tears: ‘O my
friends, save me and my children’ (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>O mes amis, sauvez-moi
et mes enfants!</em></span>). The battering of insurrectionary
axes clangs audible across the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>&OElig;il-de-B&oelig;uf</em></span>. What an
hour!...</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, too, La Fayette, suddenly aroused, not from
sleep (for his eyes had not yet closed), arrives, with passionate
eloquence, with prompt military word of command.
National Guards, suddenly roused by sound of
trumpet and alarm drum, are all arriving. The death-melly
ceases; the first sky-lambent blaze of insurrection
is got damped down; it burns now, if unextinguished, yet
flameless, as charred coals do, and not extinguishable.
The king’s apartments are safe. Ministers, officials, and
even some loyal national deputies are assembling round
their Majesties. Now, too, is witnessed the touching last
flicker of etiquette, which sinks not here in the Cimmerian
world-wreckage without a sign! as the house cricket
might still chirp in the pealing of a trump of doom.
‘Monsieur,’ said some master of ceremonies, as La Fayette,
in these fearful moments, was rushing towards the
inner royal apartments, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Monsieur, le roi vous <a id='corr155.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='accords'>accorde</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_155.24'><ins class='correction' title='accords'>accorde</ins></a></span> les
grandes entrees</em></span>’ (Monsieur, the king grants you the grand
entries)—not finding it convenient to refuse them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However, the Paris National Guard, wholly under
arms, has cleared the Palace, and even occupies the
nearer external spaces, extruding miscellaneous patriotism,
for the most part, into the grand court, or even into
the forecourt. The body-guards, you can observe, have
now of a verity hoisted the national cockade, for they
step forward to the windows or balconies, hat aloft in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>hand, on each hat a huge tricolor, and fling over their
bandoleers in sign of surrender, and shout, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive la
nation!</em></span> To which how can the generous heart respond but
with, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive le roi! vivent les gardes-du-corps!</em></span> His Majesty
himself has appeared with La Fayette on the balcony,
and again appears. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive le roi!</em></span> greets him. Her Majesty,
too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril in
it. ‘Should I die,’ she said, ‘I will do it.’ She stands
there alone, her hands serenely crossed on her breast.
Such serenity of heroism has its effect. La Fayette,
with ready wit, in his highflown, chivalrous way, takes
that fair, queenly hand and, reverently kneeling, kisses
it; thereupon the people do shout, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive la reine!</em></span></p>

<p class='c010'>“So that all, and the queen herself, nay, the very captain
of the body-guards, have grown national! The very
captain of the body-guards steps out now with La Fayette.
On the hat of the repentant man is an enormous
tricolor, large as a soup platter or sunflower, visible to
the utmost forecourt. He takes the national oath with
a loud voice, elevating his hat; at which sight all the
army raise their bonnets on their bayonets, with shouts.
Sweet is reconciliation to the heart of man. La Fayette
has sworn Flandre; he swears the remaining body-guards
down in the Marble Court; the people clasp them in
their arms: O my brothers, why would ye force us to
slay you? Behold, there is joy over you, as over returning
prodigal sons! The poor body-guards, now national
and tricolor, exchange bonnets, exchange arms; there
shall be peace and fraternity. And still, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive le roi!</em></span>’
and also, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Le roi à Paris!</em></span>’</p>

consult, and national deputies wag their heads; but
there is now no other possibility. You have forced him
to go willingly. ‘At one o’clock!’ La Fayette gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>audible assurance to that purpose; and universal insurrection,
with immeasurable shout and a discharge of all
the firearms, clear and rusty, great and small, that it has,
returns him acceptance. What a sound! heard for
leagues! a doom-peal! That sound, too, rolls away
into the silence of ages. And the Château of Versailles

grass grown, responsive to the hoe of the weeder. Times
and generations roll on, in their confused gulf-current,
and buildings, like builders, have their destiny.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>THE outburst for the time being is quelled. The king
and queen have been brought by the surging mob
to the gates of their royal residence in Paris. As they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>enter the portals, the mob cries, “Now we will have
bread! we have with us the <em>baker, and the baker’s wife,
and the baker’s son</em>!” and poor Louis falsely imagines
that peace has come.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the year of 1790 dawned, La Fayette hoped that
the light of liberty was rising. He realized that France
was not ready yet for a republic, but a constitutional
monarchy might unite king and people.</p>

<p class='c010'>In March, 1790, La Fayette writes thus to Washington:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: I have learned with much pain
that you have not received any of my letters. I hope,
however, that you have not suspected me of being guilty
of negligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is difficult in the midst of our troubles to be informed
in time of good occasions; but this time it is by
M. Cayne, who departs for London, that I confide the
care of making known to you news concerning me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our revolution proceeds on its march as well as it is
possible with a nation who receives all at once its liberties,
and is therefore liable to confound them with license.
The Assembly has more hatred against the ancient system
than experience to organize the new constitutional
government. The ministers regret their ancient power,
and dare not avail themselves of that which they have;
in short, as all which existed has been destroyed, and
replaced by institutions still very incomplete, there is
ample material for criticisms and calumnies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Add to this that we are attacked by two sets of enemies,—the
aristocrats, who aspire to a counter-revolution,
and the factions, who wish to destroy all authority,
perhaps even to attempt the life of members of the royal
family. These two parties foment these troubles.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“After having said all this, my dear General, I will
say to you with the same frankness, that we have made
admirable and almost incredible destruction of all abuses
and all prejudices; all that which was not useful to a
people, and all that pertained not to them, have been cut
off, which, in consideration of the topographical situation,
moral and political, of France, we have performed
more changes in ten months than the most presumptuous
patriots could have hoped for, and the reports of our
anarchy and our internal troubles have been much exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After all, this revolution, where one only desires to
find (as at one time in America) a little more energy in
the government, will extend and establish liberty; it will
be made to flourish in the whole world, and we can wait
tranquilly through some years until a convention corrects
the faults which could not be perceived at present by
men scarcely escaped the yoke of aristocracy and despotism.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know that the Assembly has adjourned all discussion
upon the West Indies, leaving all things in their
natural state. The ports remain thus open to American
commerce. It was impossible, under present circumstances,
to take a definite resolution. The next legislature
will form its decision according to the demands of
the colonies, which have been invited to present them,
and particularly regarding their subsistence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me, my dear General, to offer you a painting
representing the Bastile, such as it was some days after
I had given the order to destroy it. I give to you also
the principal key of that fortress of despotism. It is
a tribute which I owe to you, as a son to my adopted
father, as an aide-de-camp to my general, as a missionary
of liberty to his patriarch.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Adieu, my beloved General; offer my tender respects
to Madame Washington; speak of my affectionate regard
to George, Hamilton, Knox, Harrison, Humphrey,—all
my friends. I am with tenderness and respect,</p>

<div class='c011'>“Your affectionate and filial friend.”</div>

<p>KEY OF THE BASTILE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But La Fayette’s fond hopes regarding the dawning of
liberty in his cherished land were doomed to speedy and
terrible disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The constitution was growing under the hands of the
Assembly; the executive and legislative and judicial departments
were carefully examined and established upon
a better model. Vacillating Louis, assenting and dissenting
to every proposition, was at length partially pledged
to a freer constitution. Then came the 14th of July
and the grand festival in the Champ de Mars. King,
queen, and court, churchmen and soldiers, nuns and countesses,
nobles and peasants, all were to participate in this
national ceremony. Four days before the celebration
the different deputations met in the Hotel de Ville to
choose a president for the federation. La Fayette was
hailed President by universal acclamation. He wished
to decline the honor, but the Assembly refused to excuse
him. And still another honor awaited him. By a special
act of the Assembly the king had been appointed, for the
day of the ceremony, supreme commander of the National
Guard. This office he delegated to La Fayette, who thus
became high constable of all the armed men in the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 13th of July the Confederates, with La Fayette
at their head, repaired to the National Assembly to pay
their homage to the monarch and to that body. La Fayette
thus addressed the members: “You well knew the
necessities of France and the will of Frenchmen when
you destroyed the gothic fabric of our government and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>laws, and respected only their monarchical principle;
Europe then discovered that a good king could be the
protector of a free, as he had been the ground of comfort
to an oppressed, people. The rights of man are declared,
the sovereignty of the people acknowledged, their power
is representative, and the bases of public order are established.
Hasten, then, to give energy to the power of the
state. The people owe to you the glory of a new constitution,
but they require and expect that peace and tranquillity
which cannot exist without a firm and effectual
organization of the government. We, gentlemen, devoted
to the revolution and united in the name of liberty, the
guarantees alike of individual and common rights and
safety,—we, called by the most imperative duty from
all parts of the kingdom, founding our confidence on
your wisdom and our hopes on your services,—we will
bear without hesitation to the altar of the country the
oath which you may dictate to its soldiers. Yes, gentlemen,
our arms shall be stretched forth together, and, at
the same instant, our brothers from all parts of France
shall utter the oath which will unite them together.
May the solemnity of that great day be the signal of the
conciliation of parties, of the oblivion of resentments, and
of the establishment of public peace and happiness. And
fear not that this holy enthusiasm will hurry us beyond
the proper and prescribed limits of public order. Under
the protection of the law, the standard of liberty shall
never become the rallying point of license and disorder.
Gentlemen, we swear to you to respect the law which
it is our duty to defend, swear by our honor as free
men, and Frenchmen do not promise in vain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To King Louis, La Fayette then addressed these loyal
words: “Sire, in the course of those memorable events
which have restored to the nation its imprescriptible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>rights, and during which the energy of the people and
the virtues of their king have produced such illustrious
examples for the contemplation of the world, we love to
hail, in the person of your Majesty, the most illustrious
of all titles,—chief of the French, and king of a free
people. Enjoy, Sire, the recompense of your virtues, and
let that pure homage which despotism could not command
be the glory and reward of a citizen-king. The
National Guards of France swear to your Majesty an
obedience which shall know no other limits than those of
the law, and a love which shall only terminate with their
existence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let Carlyle again describe the scene on that memorable
14th of July.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In spite of plotting aristocrats, lazy, hired spademen,
and almost of destiny itself, for there had been much
rain, the Champ de Mars is fairly ready. The morning
comes, cold for a July one; but such a festival would
make Greenland smile. Through every inlet of that
national amphitheatre—for it is a league in circuit, cut
with openings at due intervals—floods in the living
throng, covering without tumult, space after space.
Two hundred thousand patriotic men, and, twice as good,
one hundred thousand patriotic women, all decked and
glorified, as one can fancy, sit waiting in the Champ de
Mars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a picture, that circle of bright-dyed life, spread
up there on its thirty-seated slope, leaning, one would
say, on the thick umbrage of those avenue trees, for the
stems of them are hidden by the height; and all beyond
it mere greenness of the summer earth, with the gleam
of waters, or white sparklings of stone edifices. On
remotest steeple and invisible village belfry stand men
with spy-glasses. On the heights of Chaillot are many-colored,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>undulating groups. Round, and far on, over all
the circling heights that embosom Paris it is as one more
or less peopled amphitheatre, which the eye grows dim
with measuring. Nay; heights have cannon, and a floating
battery of cannon is on the Seine. When eye fails,
ear shall serve. And all France, properly, is but one
amphitheatre; for in paved town and unpaved hamlet
men walk, listening, till the muffled thunder sounds audibly
on their horizon, that they, too, may begin swearing
and firing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But now to streams of music come confederates
enough, for they have assembled on the Boulevard St.
Antoine, and come marching through the city with their
eighty-three department banners and blessings, not loud
but deep; comes National Assembly, and takes seat under
its canopy; comes Royalty, and takes seat on a throne
beside it; and La Fayette, on a white charger, is here,
and all the civic functionaries; and the confederates
form dances till their strictly military evolutions and
man&oelig;uvres can begin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Task not the pen of mortal to describe them; truant
imagination droops, declares that it is not worth while.
There is wheeling and sweeping to slow, to quick, to
double-quick time. Sieur Motier, or Generalissimo La
Fayette—for they are one and the same, and he, as general
of France in the king’s stead, for twenty-four hours—must
step forth with that sublime, chivalrous gait of
his, solemnly ascend the steps of Fatherland’s altar, in
sight of heaven and of scarcely breathing earth, and pronounce
the oath: to king, to law, to nation, in his own
name and that of armed France; whereat there is waving
of banners and sufficient acclaim.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>GRAND FESTIVAL IN THE CHAMPS DE MARS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The National Assembly must swear, standing in its
place; the king himself, audibly. The king swears; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>now be the welkin split with vivats; let citizens, enfranchised,
embrace; armed confederates clang their arms;
and, above all, let that floating battery speak. It has
spoken, to the four corners of France! From eminence
to eminence bursts the thunder, faint heard, loud
repeated. From Arras to Avignon, from Metz to Bayonne,
over Orleans and Blois, it rolls in cannon recitative.
Puy bellows of it amid his granite mountains;
Pau, where is the shell cradle of great Henri. At far
Marseilles, one can think the ruddy evening witnesses it;
over the deep blue Mediterranean waters, the castle of
If, ruddy-tinted, darts forth from every cannon’s mouth
its tongue of fire; and all the people shout, ‘Yes, France
is free!’ Glorious France, that has burst out so into
universal sound and smoke, and attained the Phrygian
cap of Liberty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not king, or queen, but La Fayette, who is this
day the cynosure of all eyes, as he ascends the altar and
takes the prescribed oath. His noble nature is neither
paralyzed by difficulties nor weakened by popular applause.
For the people’s love he is grateful, but to gain
that approbation he would not relinquish one iota of his
principle. Neither does any rank or power tempt him to
seek his personal aggrandizement. When urged by the
deputation at this time, that he should accept the permanent
command of the military force of the realm he
unselfishly refused, accompanying his declination with
these disinterested words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let not ambition take possession of you; love the
friends of the people, but reserve blind submission for
the law, and enthusiasm for liberty. Pardon this advice,
gentlemen; you have given me the glorious right to
offer it, when, by loading me with every species of favor
which one of your brothers could receive from you, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>heart, amidst its delightful emotions, cannot repress a
feeling of fear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That the confederates fully appreciated the noble
motives which actuated his decision in this matter is
revealed by their farewell words to him:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The deputies of the National Guard of France retire
with the regret of not being able to nominate you their
chief. They respect the constitutional law, though it
checks, at this moment, the impulse of their hearts. A
circumstance which must cover you with immortal glory
is, that you, yourself, promoted the law; that you, yourself,
prescribed bounds to our gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Paris and Louis were too vacillating and unstable to
allow any permanent peace, or permit France to enjoy
any prolonged prosperity. Before the 1st of August
the solemn oath which had been taken on the Champ de
Mars was forgotten by both king and people. The
same contentions were again fanning the flames of a still
more ominous conflagration.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 26th of August, 1790, La Fayette thus writes
to General Washington:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are disturbed with revolts among the regiments;
and, as I am constantly attacked on both sides by the
aristocratic and the factious parties, I do not know to
which of the two we owe these insurrections. Our safeguard
against them is the National Guard. There are
more than a million of armed citizens, among them patriotic
legions, and my influence with them is as great as if
I had accepted the chief command. I have lately lost
some of my favor with the mob, and displeased the frantic
lovers of licentiousness, as I am bent on establishing
a legal subordination. But the nation at large is very
thankful to me for it. It is not out of the heads of
aristocrats to make a counter-revolution. Nay, they do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>what they can with all the crowned heads of Europe, who
hate us. But I think their plans will either be abandoned
or unsuccessful. I am rather more concerned at a
division that rages in the popular party. The club of
the Jacobins and that of ’89, as it is called, have divided
the friends of liberty, who accuse each other; the Jacobins
being taxed with a disorderly extravagance, and ’89
with a tincture of ministerialism and ambition. I am
endeavoring to bring about a reconciliation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To defend the king and the constitution” was La
Fayette’s unswerving purpose. There had been a time
when he had hoped that France might become a republic
like the United States; but as he carefully watched successive
events he became convinced that the nation was
not prepared for such a change, and henceforth he decided
in favor of a constitutional and limited monarchy;
and notwithstanding the king’s exasperating blindness,
in regarding La Fayette as his enemy rather than his
defender, and the queen’s open enmity, La Fayette enacted
faithfully and consistently the double and difficult
rôle of upholding the rights of royalty at the same time
that he was defending the sacred rights of the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Madame Campan says in her “Memoirs of Marie Antoinette”:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The queen gave frequent audiences to M. de La
Fayette. One day, when he was in her inner closet, his
aides-de-camp, who waited for him, were walking up and
down the great room where the persons in attendance
remained. Some imprudent young women were thoughtless
enough to say, with the intention of being overheard
by those officers, that it was very alarming to see the
queen alone with a rebel and a <em>brigand</em>. I was hurt at
such indiscretion, which always produced bad effects, and
I imposed silence on them. One of them persisted in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>appellation <em>brigand</em>. I told her that, as to rebel, M. de
La Fayette well deserved the name, but that the title of
leader of a party was given by history to every man
commanding forty thousand men, a capital, and forty
leagues of country; that kings had frequently treated
with such leaders, and if it was convenient to the queen
to do the same, it remained only for us to be silent and
respect her actions. On the morrow the queen, with a
serious air, but with the greatest kindness, asked what I
had said respecting M. de La Fayette on the preceding
day, adding that she had been assured I had enjoined her
women silence, because they did not like him, and that I
had taken his part. I repeated to the Queen what had
passed, word for word. She condescended to tell me that
I had done perfectly right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As La Fayette was the commander of the National
Guard, and as Louis and Marie Antoinette had been
brought forcibly to Paris, and were in some sense under
the <em>surveillance</em> of La Fayette and his Guard, they were
unable to perceive that he was their best friend, and they
at length determined to fly from their enforced restraint
in Paris. The plan was made and executed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so the royalty of France is actually fled? This
precious night, the shortest of the year, it flies and drives!
But in Paris, at six in the morning, when some patriot
deputy, warned by a billet, awoke La Fayette and they
went to the Tuileries? Imagination may paint, but
words cannot, the surprise of La Fayette, or with what
bewilderment helpless Gouvion rolled glassy Argus’
eyes, discerning now that his false chambermaid had told
true!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A new danger now assailed La Fayette. The infuriated
mob, apprised that the king had escaped, laid the
blame upon his keeper. “Down with La Fayette!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Away with the traitor!” are the cries which meet his
ear, as he boldly faces the vast throngs of excited Parisians
who crowd around the Hôtel de Ville. With
folded arms and calm dignity, he stood before the riotous
mob. With unflinching courage he surveyed that surging
mass in silence for a moment; then, when he spoke, it
was neither to excuse nor defend himself. His thoughts,
as ever, were not for himself; only for the interests of
the people. Casting his piercing glance over the multitude
he exclaimed, in clarion tones, in which there was
no quavering of fear or hesitation in their clear ring:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you call this event a misfortune, what name would
you give to a counter-revolution, which would deprive
you of your liberty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Filled with admiration for his courage, and inspired
with the emotion of applause, which, in the fickle fancy
of the French so quickly follows its opposite, wrath, the
vast multitude rent the air with one deafening shout:
“Let us make La Fayette our king!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the loyal Knight of Liberty instantly replied, with
stern disapprobation:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought that you professed a better opinion of me.
What have I done that you do not believe me fit for
something better?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And the admiring people, recognizing his magnanimous
unselfishness, shouted with wild enthusiasm:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“LONG LIVE THE GENERAL!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, it was announced
that La Fayette was in danger from the mob, at
the Hôtel de Ville. A deputation was sent to him, offering
an escort, to protect him from the violence of the
people. To whom La Fayette courteously replied: “I
will order an escort for you, as a mark of respect; but,
for myself, I shall return alone. I have never been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>more perfect safety than at this moment, though the
streets are filled with the people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Prompt means were taken for the arrest of the royal
fugitives.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By first or by second principles, much is promptly
decided: ministers are sent for; instructed how to continue
their functions; La Fayette is examined, and Gouvion,
who gives a most helpless account—the best he can....
La Fayette’s aide-de-camp, Rom&oelig;uf, riding <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à franc
etrier</em></span>, on that old herb-merchant’s route, quickened during
the last stages, has got to Varennes, where the ten
thousand now furiously demand, with fury of panic
terror, that royalty shall forthwith return Paris-ward,
that there be not infinite bloodshed.... So then our
grand royalist plot, of flight to Metz, has executed itself.
On Monday night royalty went; on Saturday evening it
returns; so much, within one short week, has royalty
accomplished for itself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A decree was passed by the Assembly, suspending
Louis from his kingly functions, as it was contended that
by his flight he had voluntarily abdicated the throne; and
a guard was placed over the king, queen, and Dauphin.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette, as commander-in-chief of the National
Guards, was in reality the head of the government in
France. Though Louis was his captive, he endeavored
by every attention of respect to make him feel his restraint
as little as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Jacobins had now gained the supremacy in France.
They contended that the people should elect a ruler instead
of Louis, whom they declared had relinquished his
rights. The Assembly were not yet prepared for this
step, and they resolved to restore Louis to power.</p>

<p class='c010'>A decree was therefore issued by the Assembly, removing
the ban from Louis, and declaring that he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>culpable for his recent journey. This decree raised a
storm of opposition. The day after the bill was passed,
a vast mob assembled in the Champ de Mars, to protest
against this unpopular measure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quickly the crowd raised a riotous tumult, and again
La Fayette, <em>the Patriot</em>, stood in their midst. But this
time his voice could not be heard on account of their
wild clamors, which filled the air and were echoed from
surrounding streets. When his words of command were
partially understood, their frenzy had reached too high
a pitch to be quelled; threats were muttered against
him, and even a musket was fired at his breast. But his
fearless spirit was resolved to put down this dangerous
insurrection, and he was determined not to leave the
spot until his efforts had been successful. By his nerve,
and quick plans as speedily executed, the rioters were
at length forced to give way, but not until blood had
been shed, for which his enemies called him to an account.</p>

<p class='c010'>Appreciating the necessity for a firmer government,
the Assembly completed its constitution, and it was
submitted to Louis for his acceptance. Poor vacillating
Louis was ill-pleased with this same constitution, but
the past had taught him that it was safest to submit;
and thereupon he repaired to the Assembly and accepted
the constitution, and on the 30th of September it was
declared that the Constituent Assembly had terminated
its sittings. This Assembly had been in existence three
years, and had enacted 1309 laws and decrees.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days afterwards La Fayette resigned his office
as commander-in-chief of the National Guard, deeming
that his country no longer required his public services,
and desiring intensely to retire to his private estates and
enjoy the delights of a quiet life. He sent the following
letter to his late comrades in arms:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“To serve you until this day, gentlemen, was a duty
imposed upon me by the sentiments which have animated
my whole life. To resign now, without reserve, to my
country, all the power and influence she gave me for the
purpose of defending her during recent convulsions,—is
a duty which I owe to my well-known resolutions, and
it amply satisfies the only sort of ambition I possess.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Guard could not part with him without renewed
expressions of admiration for their idol. Finding that
they could not move him, by their persuasions, to withdraw
his resignation, they forged a sword from the bolts
of the Bastile, and presented it to him, with profound
marks of their esteem and affection. The municipality
of Paris voted him a medal, and ordered a complimentary
inscription to be placed upon the bust of La Fayette,
which had been presented by Virginia to the city of
Paris twelve years before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now that his Majesty has accepted the constitution,
to the sound of cannon-salvoes, who would not hope?
La Fayette has moved for an amnesty, for universal
forgiving and forgetting of revolutionary faults; and
now surely the glorious revolution, cleared of its rubbish,
is complete.... Welcome, surely, to all right hearts, is
La Fayette’s chivalrous amnesty. The National Constituent
Assembly declares that it has finished its mission;
so, amid glitter of illuminated streets and Champs Elysées,
and crackle of fireworks, and glad deray, has the
first National Assembly vanished.... La Fayette, for
his part, will lay down the command. He retires, Cincinnatus-like,
to his hearth and farm, but soon leaves
them again.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE KING ACCEPTING THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But the king and court seem blindly destined to bring
about their own destruction. The Royalists, far from
distinguishing between such men as La Fayette, Robespierre,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and Pétion, strengthened the hands of the two
last, thinking by those means to weaken the former.
The court, incited by the queen, treated La Fayette with
a blindfold hatred, by opposing Pétion to him at every
turn. When the honest, well-meaning soldier was about
to be elected mayor of Paris, Marie Antoinette, through
her machinations, caused the nomination of Pétion, who
employed his exalted position in overturning the throne
and the constitution. But not only was France at the
mercy of the factions within, but foreign hosts threatened
them without.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s quiet life of repose was soon disturbed.
Startling rumors reached Paris that a large army was
preparing for an invasion. Quick to respond to his country’s
call, La Fayette relinquished his coveted delights
of rest and reunion with his family, and accepted the
command of one of the three armies which France was
raising to meet the advancing foe.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this time La Fayette issued the following stirring
proclamation to his army:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Soldiers of our Country!</span></p>

<p class='c010'>“The legislative corps and the king, in the name of
the French people, have declared war. Since the country,
by constitutional means and by her will, calls us to
defend her, what citizen can refuse to her his arm?</p>

<p class='c010'>“At this moment, when we leaders take again the
oath which was pronounced by the nation and army
upon the altar of the Federation, I come to explain my
intentions, and to recall to you my principles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Convinced by the experience of a life devoted to
Liberty, that she can only be preserved in the midst
of citizens submissive to the laws, as she can only be
defended by disciplined troops, I have served the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>without cajoling them, and in my constant struggle
against license and anarchy I have incurred the honorable
hatred of the ambitious, and of all factions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-day that the army awaits me, it is not with a
pernicious complaisance, but with an inflexible discipline,
and with a rigorous fulfilment of duty, that I will justify
the affection which they accord to me, and the esteem
which they owe me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But since I control free men by the imperious will
of a chief, it is necessary that we all feel—general,
officers, and soldiers—that in this coming war it is a
combat to the death between our principles and the
pretensions of despots. We must work for the rights of
each citizen and the safety of all. We must work for
the constitution which we have sworn by, and for the
sacred cause of liberty and equality. In short, we must
work for the National Sovereignty, by which only we
shall be able to resist any such combination of force and
danger as there may be; and without which, not only
will the French people, but humanity itself, be betrayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Soldiers of Liberty! it is not sufficient for merit to
be brave; be patient, indefatigable. Your general ought
to plan and order; you, to obey. Be generous! respect
a disarmed enemy. Those troops which always grant
quarter, and will never receive it, will be invincible.
Let us be disinterested, so that the shameful idea of
pillage will never soil the nobility of our motives. Let
us be humane; it will make every one admire our sentiments
and bless our laws.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Resolve ye, with your general, that we shall see Liberty
triumph, or that we shall not survive her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Soldiers of the Constitution! fear not that she ceases
to watch you when you fight for her. Fear not when
you go to defend your country, that these internal dissensions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>shall trouble your firesides. Without doubt the
legislative corps and the king will intimately unite in
the decisive moment to insure the empire and the law,
every one, and their property will be respected. Civil
and religious liberty will not be profaned; the peaceable
citizen will be protected, whatever may be his
opinions; the culpable will be punished, whatever may be
his pretences.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All parties will be dispelled, and the constitution
alone will rule; and upon the rebels who have attacked
with open voice, and upon the traitors, who have perverted
it by their vile passions, will be meted out such
judgment as shall make them fear it inwardly and respect
it outwardly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, we will have the reward of our labor and of our
blood. Let us all attest with confidence,—both the representatives
elected by the people who have sworn to
transact only the duties of the constitution, as we its
dangers; and the hereditary representative, the citizen-king,
whom the constitution has firmly established upon
the throne; and all the other depositories of authority to
whom the constitution has delegated power,—let them all
believe that the execution of that authority is a duty
which the constitution has laid upon them, as obedience
is demanded from those who must submit to them; and
that any one transgresses the laws in not making them
to be obeyed, as they were placed in office that the laws
might be defended.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us also affirm, all ye National Guard, that the
constitution, newly born, shall find us united for its establishment,
and that the constitution, in peril, will always
find us ready to defend it; for patriotism renders even
glorious the calumnies which we may have to endure in
support of the constitution.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“As for us, furnished with the arms which liberty has
consecrated, and with the declaration of rights, let us
march towards our enemies!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The central army was assigned to La Fayette, with his
headquarters at Metz. War was declared against Austria
on the 20th of April, and on the 24th La Fayette was
ordered to collect his regiments and report at Metz by
the 1st of May. This required such marvellous celerity
that his enemies hoped he would fail to accomplish it,
but on the appointed day La Fayette was at the post
assigned, awaiting further orders. From his camp at
Metz La Fayette wrote thus to Washington:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a very different date from that which had
announced to you my return to the sweets of private life,
a situation hitherto not very familiar to me, but which,
after fifteen revolutionary years, I had become quite
fit to enjoy. I have given you an account of the quiet
and rural mode of living I had adopted in the mountains
where I was born, having there a good house and a <em>late</em>
manor, now unlorded into a large farm, with an English
overseer for my instruction. For as I have relinquished
my title of nobility, I manage my estate as a simple
country gentleman. I felt myself very happy among
my neighbors, no more vassals to me nor anybody, and
had given to my wife and rising family the only quiet
weeks they had enjoyed for a long time, when the threats
and mad preparations of the refugees, and, still more, the
countenance they had obtained in the dominions of our
neighbors, induced the National Assembly and the king
to adopt a more rigorous system than had hitherto been
the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had declined every public employment that had been
offered by the people, and, still more, had I refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>consent to my being appointed to any military command;
but when I saw our liberties and constitution were seriously
threatened, and my services could be usefully employed
in fighting for our old cause, I could no longer
resist the wishes of my countrymen; and as soon as the
king’s express reached my farm, I set out for Paris; from
thence to this place; and I do not think it uninteresting
to you, my dear General, to add, that I was everywhere
on the road affectionately welcomed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again La Fayette writes to Washington, in March,
1792, from Paris, whither he had been recalled from
Metz by political affairs:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: I have been called from the
army to the capital for a conference between two other
generals, the ministers, and myself; and I am at present
about to return to my post. The coalition of the continental
powers concerning that which touches our affairs,
is certain, and will not be broken by the death of the
Emperor Leopold II. But as regards the preparations
for their continental war, it is yet doubtful whether our
neighbors will dare approach in order to extinguish a
flame so contagious as that of liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The danger for us is in the state of anarchy which
arises from the ignorance of the people, from the immense
numbers of non-proprietors, and from the habitual mistrust
regarding every kind of measure of the government.
The difficulties are augmented by the discontents and
the distinguished aristocrats, because these two parties
unite in counteracting our ideas of public order.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not believe, however, my dear General, the exaggerated
accounts which you will receive, especially those
which come from England. Liberty and equality will be
preserved in France, that is certain; but if they succumb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>you may know well that I will not have survived them.
Yon can be assured, however, that we go forth to meet
this painful present situation, by an honorable defence,
and for the amelioration of our internal affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have not had time to prove just at what point our
constitution can bring to us a good government. We
know only that it is established upon the rights of the
people, destroys nearly all abuses, changes French vassalage
into national dignity; in short, it renders to men the
enjoyment of their faculties, which nature has given to
them, and which society assures to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me, my dear General, to present to you alone
an observation upon the last choice of an American ambassador.
I am a personal friend of Gouverneur Morris,
and I have always been, as an individual, content with
him; but the aristocratic principles, and even counter-revolutionary
ones which he has professed, render him
scarcely the proper person to represent the only nation
of which the government resembles ours, since both of
them are founded upon the plan of a democratic representation.
I will add, that as France finds herself surrounded
by enemies, it would seem that America ought to desire
to conform herself to the changes in our government.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I speak not only of those which democratic principles
can hasten and introduce, but of those new projects of
the aristocracy, such as the re-establishment of a nobility,
the creation of a chamber of peers, and other political
blasphemies of that kind, which, so far as we are able, we
shall not have realized in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have desired that we should establish an elective
senate, a more independent judiciary corps, and a more
energetic administration; but it is necessary that the people
should be taught to know the advantages of a firm
government before knowing how to reconcile it with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>ideas of liberty, and to distinguish it from those arbitrary
systems which it has overthrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see, my dear General, I am not an enthusiast
regarding all the clauses of our constitution, though I
love those principles which resemble those of the United
States; as to the exception of an hereditary president of
executive power, I believe it conforms to our circumstances
at present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I hate all that resembles despotism and the aristocracy,
and I cannot relinquish the desire that these
principles, American and French, should be in the heart
and upon the lips of the ambassador of the United States
in France. I make these reflections in case only that some
arrangements conformable to the wishes of Gouverneur
Morris can in the sequel be made.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me to add here the tribute of praise which
I owe to M. Short for the sentiments which he has
expressed, and for all the esteem which he has inspired
in this country, I desire that you should personally
recognize it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are changes in the ministry preparing. The
king has chosen his council from the most violent portion
of the popular party, that is to say, from the club of the
Jacobins, a kind of Jesuitical institution more likely to
make deserters from our cause than to attract to us followers.
These new ministers, however, are not suspected
of being able to have a chance of re-establishing order.
They discuss that which they should apply to themselves.
The Assembly is little enlightened; they value too highly
popular applause. The king in his daily conduct from
time to time acts very well. After all, the thing will go
on, and the success of the revolution cannot be placed in
doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My command extends upon the frontiers from Givet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>to Bitche. I have sixty thousand men, and this number
will be increased by young men who will come from all
parts of the empire to complete the regiments. The voluntary
recruits are animated by a spirit most patriotic.
I go to make an entrenched camp with thirty thousand
men, and with a detached corps of four to five thousand;
the remainder of the troops will occupy strong places.
The armies of the Maréchaux Luckner and Rochambeau
are inferior to mine, because we have sent several regiments
south; but in case of war we can gather respectable
forces.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we have yet some reasons for discontent, we can,
however, hope to attain our just cause. License, under
the mask of patriotism, is our greatest evil, because it
menaces property, tranquillity, and even liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Adieu, my dear General; think sometimes of your
respectful, tender, and filial friend.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>But La Fayette’s confidence in his countrymen was
repaid by ingratitude; and he was yet to learn that
few men were actuated by his unselfish loyalty and stern
integrity.</p>

<div id='i232'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i-232.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MOB INVADE THE TUILERIES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>His enemies now plotted his ruin. A treacherous plan
was laid to draw off his expected re-enforcements, so that
when he reached Givet, he would find himself at the
mercy of the advancing foe. This disgraceful scheme was
put into execution, and La Fayette, finding himself exposed
to overwhelming dangers, wisely retreated to his
former post to await further developments. But soon
the direful rumors from Paris filled his patriotic heart
with more painful concern than his own perilous position.
“Would that he had trusted me!” exclaimed magnanimous
La Fayette, as courier after courier brought
news of the woes thickening around the helpless, weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>king. In a letter to the Assembly, La Fayette boldly
declared war against the defiant Jacobins, who were fast
clutching the reins of government, or, rather, planning a
counter-revolution, which should give up the city and
the nation to the diabolical power of a wild anarchy and
unbridled license. It was this memorable letter in which
he said: “Can you dissemble even to yourselves that a
faction—and to avoid all vague demonstrations, the <em>Jacobin
faction</em>—have caused all these disorders? It is that
society which I boldly denounce; organized in its affiliated
societies like a separate empire in the metropolis,
and blindly governed by some ambitious leaders, this
society forms a totally distinct corporation in the midst
of the French nation, whose power it usurps by tyrannizing
over its representatives and constituted authorities.
Let the royal authority be untouched, for it is
guaranteed by the constitution; let it be independent,
for its independence is one of the springs of our liberty;
let the king be revered, for he is invested with the majesty
of the nation; let him choose a ministry which
wears the chain of no faction; and if traitors exist, let
them perish under the sword of the law.”</p>

<p class='c010'>No other man in France would have dared to write
such a letter; and this brave letter lost him his popularity,
for the masses were imbued with the influence of
the Jacobins. This party now took an oath to destroy
the fearless marquis who had thus laid bare their base
designs. They harangued the mob, and persuaded them
to believe that Louis and La Fayette were leagued against
them. It required little to inflame the excited people.
Twenty thousand men from the lowest ranks paraded
the streets, and with wild shouts of “<em>Down with the
king! to the Tuileries!</em>” they swept onward to the palace,
and with yells of execration they trampled down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the guard and burst into the very apartment of the king.
Louis for once was roused and played the part of a man.
His calmness awed the mob; and the Assembly sending
a deputation to his relief, the multitude were persuaded
to retire.</p>

<p class='c010'>This news was wafted quickly to La Fayette; and on
the 28th of June he appeared in Paris. He left the
army, and came alone as a simple citizen, and, visiting
the Assembly, he boldly met their charge against him,
which was that he had made an attempt at dictation;
and he was there to answer this slander, and to demand
reparation for the indignity to which the king had
been subjected. He ended his speech with the words,
“Such are the representations submitted to the Assembly
by a citizen whose love for liberty, at least, will not
be disputed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Jacobin leaders had now the upper hand in
the Assembly; and they declared him guilty of treason.
And when the chivalrous and true-hearted La Fayette
waited upon the king, for whom he had risked his reputation
and his life, “he was insulted by the courtiers,
coolly received by the king, and the queen expressly forbade
any one to give him the slightest support. His
efforts at rallying around him the National Guard, in
order to march upon the Jacobins and make them prisoners,
proved equally fruitless. He returned full of grief,
but not utterly discouraged, to the army, whence he continued
to offer his services to the king; but all his offers
were rejected. ‘The best counsel I can give M. de La
Fayette,’ answered the king, ‘is to serve as a scarecrow
to the factions in following his profession as a general.’”</p>

<div id='i236'  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i-236.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>PRINCESS ELIZABETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Princess Elizabeth, more clear-sighted than Louis
XVI. and Marie Antoinette, advised that the royal
family should throw themselves with confidence into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the protection of the only man who could save the king
and deliver his family from the awful dangers which
threatened them. But the imprudent queen is reported
to have replied, “It is better to perish than to be saved
by La Fayette and the Constitutionals.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus was this noble-spirited man rewarded by those
whom he had risked his life to try to save.</p>

<p class='c010'>The awful Reign of Terror came remorselessly striding
on in its resistless march of death. La Fayette made
one more attempt to save the perverse and blinded king
and queen. A plan was formed for removing the royal
family from Paris, and placing them under the protection
of the army of which La Fayette had command; but the
haughty Marie Antoinette replied, “No; we have once
owed our lives to La Fayette; but I should not wish it
to be the case a second time.” Thus was their last
chance of escape refused, and the Reign of Terror soon
numbered them among its victims.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the diabolical Reign of Terror also laid its ghastly
hand upon the freedom of the Knight of Liberty, and
against his illustrious name wrote this infamous “<em>Decree
of Accusation</em>”:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>National Assembly</span>, Aug. 17, 1792.</div>

<p class='c010'>“I. It appears to this Assembly that there is just
ground for accusation against M. de La Fayette, heretofore
commander of the army of the North.</p>

<p class='c010'>“II. The executive power shall, in the most expeditious
manner possible, carry the present decree into execution;
and all constituted authorities, all citizens, and
all soldiers are hereby enjoined, by every means in their
power, to secure his person.</p>

<p class='c010'>“III. The Assembly forbids the army of the North
any longer to acknowledge him as a general, or to obey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his orders; and strictly enjoins that no person whatsoever
shall furnish anything to the troops, or pay any
money for their use, but by the orders of M. Dumouriez.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This decree was widely circulated throughout the
army. Against such a hydra-headed demon of persecution
it was useless to attempt to contend. La Fayette’s
only safety lay in flight. For his king and his country
he had sacrificed all that was dear to him in life; and
this was his thankless reward.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this time La Fayette thus wrote to his wife:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I make no apology to you or my children for having
ruined my family; no one among you would wish to owe
fortune to conduct contrary to my conscience.” Surely
the actions of his heroic wife and brave children fully
confirmed his exalted opinion of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>After taking every necessary precaution for the safety
of his army, La Fayette and his three friends, Messieurs
Latour-Maubourg, Bureaux de Pusy, and Alexandre Lameth,
with a little party of twenty-three exiles, departed
from France and turned their faces towards the Netherlands.
Reaching Rochefort, La Fayette and his friends
endeavored to obtain passports. But La Fayette was
quickly recognized, and the commandant instantly despatched
a messenger to the Austrian general at Namur,
with the startling intelligence that he held in safe-keeping
the illustrious La Fayette, one of the bravest generals
of France. The Austrian general, Moitelle, could scarcely
credit this astounding piece of good fortune. “What!”
exclaimed he, “La Fayette? <em>La Fayette?</em>” Turning to
one officer, he cried, “Run instantly and inform the Duke
of Bourbon of it”; to another the order was given, “Set
out this moment and carry this news to his Royal Highness
at Brussels”; and sending others here and there to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>spread the wonderful intelligence: before many hours
the news had been despatched to half the princes and
generals in Europe, that the illustrious La Fayette was
a captive in the hands of the allies. The prisoners were
conducted to Namur, then to Nivelles, and afterwards to
Luxembourg, where an attempt was made to assassinate
La Fayette by some of the French refugees. The Austrians
finally decided that La Fayette and his three companions
should be given over into the power of the Prussians.
The captives were accordingly closely guarded
and hurried to Wessel. Here they were separated and
thrown into different cells. The many shameful indignities
which they suffered and the hardships of their
cruel prison life soon prostrated La Fayette, and he
became dangerously ill, and for a time his life was despaired
of. No mitigation of his confinement was, however,
allowed him. Once the king of Prussia offered him
aid if he would assist in the plans forming against France.
La Fayette received this base message with indignant
scorn, and bade the officer return and inform his master
“that he was still <em>La Fayette</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The king, foiled in his attempt to weaken the stanch
loyalty of the heroic marquis, who would not swerve one
hair‘s-breadth from his conscientious principles, even for
the longed-for boon of liberty, determined to wreak his
mortified pride by inflicting further cruelties upon the
helpless captives, whom, though he could not bribe to
dishonor, he might still torture to death.</p>

<p class='c010'>The monarch resolved to gratify his malignity by removing
them to still more dismal and unhealthy dungeons.
Whereupon, the prisoners were conducted to
Magdebourg; and as they were thrown into the loathsome
vaults of that prison, they were informed that they
should never again behold the light of day. Here they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>existed, desolate and despairing, for a year. Frederic
William occasionally sent to learn if their sufferings
were sufficiently intense to satisfy his fiendish cruelty,
and then devised new torments. La Fayette dared not
send letters to his wife, fearing that his writing would
be recognized, and accordingly addressed them to a friend
in England, hoping that his family would in some manner
receive them. He thus describes his situation:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Imagine an opening made under the rampart of the
citadel, and surrounded with a strong high palisade;
through this, after opening four doors, each armed with
chains, bars, and padlocks, they come, not without some
difficulty and noise, to my cell, three paces wide, five and
a half long. The wall is mouldy on the side of the ditch,
and the front one admits light, but not sunshine, through
a little grated window. Add to this two sentinels,
whose eyes penetrate into this lower region, but who are
kept outside the palisade, lest they should speak; other
watchers not belonging to the guard; and all the walls,
ramparts, ditches, guards, within and without the citadel
of Magdebourg, and you will think that the foreign
powers neglect nothing to keep us within their
dominions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The noisy opening of the four doors is repeated every
morning to admit my servant; at dinner, that I may eat
in the presence of the commandant of the citadel and of
the guard; and at night, to take my servant to his prison.
After having shut upon me all the doors, the commandant
carries off the keys to the room where, since our arrival,
the king has ordered him to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have books, the white leaves of which are taken
out, but no news, no newspapers, no communications,—neither
pen, ink, paper, nor pencil. It is a wonder that
I possess this sheet, and I am writing with a toothpick.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>My health fails daily.... The account I have given
you may serve for my companions, whose treatment is
the same.”</p>

<p class='c024'>At length, despairing of making La Fayette yield by
any cruelties, however barbarous, the Prussian king,
fearing that the peace which he was concluding with
France would require the surrender of La Fayette, he
determined to transfer him, with Maubourg and De Pusy,
to the Austrians.</p>

<p class='c010'>Olmütz was selected by their new jailers, and the
prisoners were accordingly carried thither.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='corr187.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“Though'>Though</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_187.12'><ins class='correction' title='“Though'>Though</ins></a></span> placed within the same castle, and occupying
cells in the same corridor, the friends were as completely
guarded against all intercourse with each other, and all
knowledge of each other’s condition, as if an ocean or a
continent separated them. As they entered their cells,
it was declared to each of them, “that they would never
come out of them alive; that they would never see anything
but what was enclosed within the four walls of
their respective cells; that they would hold no communication
with the outer world, nor receive any kind of
information of persons or things there; that their jailers
were even prohibited from pronouncing their names;
that in the prison reports and government despatches
they would be referred to only by the number of their
cells; that they would never be suffered to learn anything
of the situation of their families, or even to know
of each other’s existence; and that, as such a situation
of hopeless confinement would naturally incite to suicide,
knives and forks, and all other instruments by which
they might do violence to themselves, would be thenceforth
withheld from them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Such were Austria’s improvements upon the cruelties
of Prussia.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>In a dark and loathsome dungeon, the walls of which
were twelve feet thick, and guarded by doors of wood
and iron, covered with bolts and bars, the only air admitted
into the cell coming through a loophole in the
wall, beneath which was a ditch of stagnant water whose
poisonous effluvium stifled the suffering victim on a bed
of rotten straw filled with vermin, by the side of which
stood a worm-eaten table and broken chair, lay the sick
and tortured La Fayette, whose keen anxieties regarding
the fate of his adored wife and children were added
to the bodily torments which his enemies inflicted upon
him. Again he became ill. His physician represented
to the authorities that fresh air was absolutely necessary;
three times the brutal answer was sent, “He is
not yet sick enough.” At length, however, he was
allowed a daily walk of a few moments under the eye
of his jailer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news of the imprisonment of La Fayette had been
received with profound sorrow throughout the world.
Many efforts had been put forth in his behalf from time
to time. While La Fayette was at Magdebourg, the
American minister in France took upon himself the responsibility
of directing the banker of the United States,
at Hamburgh, to advance ten thousand florins, which
were sent to La Fayette, and was the means of procuring
for him many needed comforts. This act was afterwards
ratified by Congress under the head of military
compensation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The imprisonment of his loyal and devoted young
friend caused the warm heart of Washington the deepest
anguish, but, as the president of a neutral nation,
his public acts were governed by caution; though his
personal influence as a man in behalf of his friend
was strong in endeavoring to secure the release of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the marquis. To Mr. Pinckney, then in Europe, he
thus wrote:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I need hardly mention how much my sensibility has
been hurt by the treatment this gentleman has met with,
or how anxious I am to see him liberated therefrom;
but what course to pursue as most likely and proper to
aid the measure is not quite so easy to decide on. As
President of the United States, there must not be a commitment
of the government by any interference of mine;
and it is no easy matter in a transaction of this nature
for a public character to assume the garb of a private
citizen in a case that does not relate to himself. Yet
such is my wish to contribute my mite to accomplish
that desirable object, that I have no objection to its
being known to the imperial ambassador in London, who,
if he think proper, may communicate it to his court,
that this event is an ardent wish of the people of the
United States, to which I sincerely add mine. The
time, the manner, and even the measure itself, I leave
to your discretion; as circumstances, and every matter
which concerns this gentleman, are better known on
that than they are on this side of the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At length a young German physician, Dr. J. Erick
Bollman, filled with admiration for the illustrious and
persecuted La Fayette, although he had never seen him,
nevertheless enthusiastically espoused his cause, and
determined to attempt the liberation of the marquis.
Meeting at Vienna Francis Kinlock Huger, the son of
Colonel Huger, of South Carolina, at whose house La
Fayette was first received when he landed in America,
the two young men resolved to attempt at all risks to
<a id='corr189.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic: missing word'>themselves his release</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_189.32'><ins class='correction' title='sic: missing word'>themselves his release</ins></a></span>. They were so far successful, that
by their aid La Fayette eluded his jailers, while out for
exercise, and mounted a horse provided by his friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and succeeded in reaching Sternberg, but was there again
arrested and carried back to endure still greater tortures
in his loathsome prison at Olmütz. His two devoted
friends were also captured and obliged to suffer imprisonment
for six months, as a punishment for their unselfish
deed; while La Fayette was informed by his cruel tormentors
that his zealous friends were to be executed for
their attempt in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>LEAVING La Fayette for a time in his gloomy prison
at Olmütz, we will turn once again to the writings
of Virginie La Fayette (Madame de Lasteyrie) for the
home picture of La Fayette’s history during the memorable
French Revolution. She says:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“The Revolution had for a long time back been gradually
approaching. The States-General were convoked
and met in the month of May, 1789. After the 14th
of July father was elected commander-in-chief of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>National Guard of Paris. His whole existence was
bound up with the events of that period. You may
imagine the cruel anxiety in which my mother passed
the three first years of the Revolution. She was free
from all prejudice; besides, she had long shared my
father’s principles, which would in any case have been
her own; she approved, she admired his conduct; she
was the partner of all his views, and was supported in
the midst of her moral sufferings by the thought that he
was working to obtain the triumph of right. The first
misfortunes of the Revolution filled her soul with such
bitterness that she was insensible to the natural feelings
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>amour-propre</em></span>, which my father’s conduct would otherwise
have called forth. Her only satisfaction was to see
him often sacrifice his popularity to oppose any disorderly
or arbitrary act. She had adopted liberal opinions,
and professed them openly, but she possessed that
feminine tact, the shades of which it would be impossible
to delineate, and was thereby prevented from being what
was then called a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>femme de parti</em></span>. Her disposition led
her not to fear the censure of certain <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coteries</em></span>, but she
shuddered when she thought of the incalculable consequences
of the events which were taking place, and she
was incessantly praying for the mercy of God, whilst she
fulfilled all the requirements of her arduous life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She accepted the requests, which were made to her
by each of the sixty districts of Paris, to collect subscriptions
at the blessing of their banners and at other
patriotic ceremonies. My father kept open house. She
did the honors in a manner which charmed her numerous
guests; but what she suffered in the depths of her
heart can only be understood by those who have heard
her talk of those times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She beheld my father at the head of a revolution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the issue of which it was impossible to foresee. Each
calamity, each disturbance, was looked upon by her without
the slightest illusion as to the success of her own
cause. She was, however, supported by my father’s principles,
and so convinced of the good it was in his power
to do, and of the evil it was in his power to avert, that
she bore with incredible fortitude the continual perils to
which he was exposed. Never, has she often told us,
did she see him leave the house during that period without
thinking that she was bidding him adieu for the last
time. Although no one could be more terrified than she
was when those whom she loved were in danger, still,
during that time she was superior to her usual self, devoted
in common with my father to the hope of preventing
crime.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The various events of the Revolution, the dangers
incurred by my father, the manner in which he supported
every principle of justice and of liberty against
all parties, form the history of my mother’s anxieties
and consolations during two years and a half. You have
read in the history of the Revolution that considerable
uproar was raised on the Monday of Passion Week, 1791,
to prevent the king from going to Saint Cloud, where he
wished to receive the sacrament from the hands of
priests who had not taken the oath to support the constitution.
The king did not put this plan into execution,
notwithstanding the endeavors of my father, who entreated
Louis XVI. to persist in his intention, which
he undertook to have executed. The king refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father, displeased with the National Guard, who
had but feebly supported him in presence of the populace,
and with the king’s weakness, which rendered it
impossible to retrieve the faults committed on that day,
thought fit to resign the command of the National Guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of Paris, and to avoid all entreaties, he quitted his own
house. My mother remained at home, transported with
joy at the resolution he had taken, and was charged by
him to receive in his stead the municipality and the
sixty battalions who came to implore him to resume his
command. She replied to each individual in the words
which my father himself would have dictated, carefully
marking by her demeanor the distinction she made
between the most respectable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>chefs de bataillon</em></span>, and
those who, like Santerre, had necessitated by their misconduct
my father’s resignation, and who that day all
united in taking the same step and repeating the same
protestations. My mother, perplexed as she was in performing
so difficult a task, was overjoyed at the thought
that my father had returned to private life. This satisfaction
lasted four days. Having thus marked his displeasure
at disorders which he had not been able to prevent,
my father yielded to the general entreaties. He
resumed his command, and my mother her trials and
anxieties.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 21st of June of the same year, 1791, the king
left Paris secretly, but was soon brought back from Varennes,
where he had been arrested. In no other circumstance
of my father’s life did my mother so much admire
him as in the one which I am now relating. She beheld
him, on the one hand, relinquishing all his republican
tendencies to join in the wish of the majority; on the
other hand, amidst the difficulties in which he was placed
by his position, taking every responsibility, bearing all
censure so as to insure the safety of the royal family,
and spare them, as much as was in his power, every
painful detail. My mother hastened to the Tuileries so
soon as the queen began to receive, and before the constitution
had been accepted. She found herself there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the only woman connected with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>patriote</em></span> party, for
she believed as my father did, that politics at such a
moment ought not to rule personal intercourse.</p>

<p>RETURN OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TO PARIS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The Jacobins raised on the 17th of July a considerable
outbreak. The <em>brigands</em> commenced by murdering two
men. Martial law was proclaimed. It is difficult to
form an idea of my mother’s mortal anguish while my
father was in the Champ de Mars, exposed to the rage of
an infuriated multitude, which dispersed crying out that
my mother must be put to death and her head carried to
meet him. I remember the fearful cries we heard, I remember
the alarm of everybody in the house, and above
all my mother’s joy at the thought that the <em>brigands</em>
who were coming to attack her were no longer surrounding
my father in the Champ de Mars. While embracing
us with tears of joy, she took every necessary precaution
against the approaching danger with the greatest calmness,
and above all with the greatest relief of mind. The
guard had been doubled, and was drawn up before the
house, but the <em>brigands</em> were very near entering my
mother’s apartment by the garden looking upon the
Place du Palais-Bourbon, and were already climbing the
low wall which protected us, when a body of cavalry
passed on the Place and dispersed them.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='corr195.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='The'>“The</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_195.25'><ins class='correction' title='The'>“The</ins></a></span> constitution having been accepted by the king,
the Constituent Assembly ended its sittings, and was replaced
by the Legislative Assembly. My father gave up
the command of the National Guard, and set out for Auvergne
with my mother in the beginning of October.
The journey was long, for they were often obliged to stop
in order to acknowledge the marks of sympathy they received
on the way. We followed in another carriage,
and my brother joined us shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This interval of repose was of short duration. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>father was appointed to the command of one of the three
armies which were formed at that time. He left Chavaniac
in December, 1791. This departure, the expectation
of an approaching war, the dread of fresh disturbances,
all contributed to renew my mother’s distress:
those who might have shared her feelings had left her.
My grandmother, and, soon after, my aunt de Noailles
were obliged to return to Paris. She bade them a farewell
which she was far from supposing was to be the
last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“War was declared in the month of March, 1792. It
began by several skirmishes with my father’s army, in one
of which M. de Gouvion, who had been major-general of
the National Guard, was killed. My mother was filled
with terror and harassed by fearful forebodings. The
disturbances at home added to her dismay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father’s letter to the Legislative Assembly, written
from the camp of Maubenge, on June 16, 1792,
against the Jacobins, and his appearance at the bar to
support it, mingled with these anxieties the satisfaction
she was accustomed to find in all his actions. But one
can well understand how much she must have suffered
at such a distance, on seeing him exposed to so many
and such various dangers. He invited her to go and join
him; but in those times of public commotion she feared
that if she accepted his proposal, he might be accused
of wishing to put his family in safety: she was also
afraid of impeding his movements, which depended on so
many uncertain events. After having thought it over
several days, she decided upon sacrificing herself and
remaining at Chavaniac.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shortly after the noble resolution my mother had
taken of remaining at Chavaniac, she received intelligence
of the insurrection of the 10th of August. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>heard almost at the same time that my grandfather, the
Duc d’Ayen, who had been defending the king at the
Tuileries, and my uncle, M. de Grammont, who had been
sought for amongst the dead, had both escaped the dangers
of that dreadful day. The newspapers gave details
of my father’s resistance at Sédan. But it was soon evident
that all was useless, and nothing could be compared
to the anguish of my mother’s heart during the days
which followed. The public papers were full of sanguinary
decrees which were submitted to everywhere
except in the district under my father’s command. A
price was set on his head, promises were made at the
bar of the Assembly to bring him back, dead or alive.
At length, on the 24th of August, she received a letter
from her sister, Madame de Noailles, telling her that my
father was out of France. My mother’s joy was equal
to her despair on the preceding days.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were in daily expectation of the house being pillaged.
My mother provided for everything, burnt or
concealed her papers; then, in consequence of the alarming
intelligence she received, she resolved to place her
children in safety. A priest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>assermenté</em></span><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> came to offer
her a place of refuge amidst the mountains. M. Frestel
took my brother there during the night. The same evening
she sent us to Langeac, a small town about two
leagues from Chavaniac, and thus having made every
arrangement, she calmly awaited coming events. She
remained with my aunt, whom it would have been impossible
to persuade to leave the place.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c010'>“Nevertheless, some days afterwards, calmer feelings
having prevailed around her, my mother thought it
might be useful for her to go to Brioude, the chief town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of the district. There she received from many people
proofs of the most lively interest; but she refused the
marks of sympathy proffered by several <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>aristocrates</em></span> ladies,
declaring she would take as an insult any token of
esteem which could not be shared with my father, and
which would tend to separate her cause from his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By a decree of the ‘district,’ the seals were affixed
on the house. My mother herself had caused this measure
to be taken, so as to command respect from the <em>brigands</em>,
who were every day expected. The word <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>émigré</em></span>
was not inscribed in the official report, and the respect
shown by the two commissaries led her to hope that she
had nothing to dread, at least on the part of the administration.
She therefore yielded to the earnest entreaties
of her daughters, and allowed them to return to Chavaniac.
We found her in possession of two letters from my
father, written after his departure from France. These
letters cheered her greatly. Although she flattered herself
that he would soon be released, she was nevertheless
much agitated by the news of his arrest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 10th of September, 1792, at eight o’clock in
the morning, the house was invested by a party of armed
men. A commissary presented my mother with an order
from the Committee of Public Safety, giving directions
for her to be sent to Paris with her children. This order
was enclosed in a letter from M. Roland, charging
him with the execution of this decree. At that very
moment my sister entered the room. She had managed
to escape from our governess so as to take away all
means of hiding her and separating her from my mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother did not show the least alarm. She
wished to put herself as soon as possible under the protection
of those authorities who could give her effectual
aid. She had the horses harnessed immediately, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>while the preparations for departure were being made,
her writing-desk was opened, and my father’s letters
seized.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You will see in them, sir,’ said my mother to the
commissary, ‘that if there had been tribunals in France,
M. de La Fayette would have submitted to them, certain
as he was that not an action of his life could criminate
him in the eyes of real patriots.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Nowadays, madam,’ he answered, ‘public opinion
is the only tribunal.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“During that time the soldiers were exploring the
house. One of them, on seeing the old family pictures,
said to the housekeeper, who was nearly blind from old
age:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Who are these? some grand <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>aristocrates</em></span>, no doubt?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Good people who are no more,’ she answered. ‘If
they were still alive, things would not be going on as
badly as they are now.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The soldiers contented themselves with running their
bayonets through several pictures. My mother slipped
away to give orders for my concealment. Then, with my
sister, who would not leave her for a minute, and my
aunt, then seventy-three years of age, they departed, followed
by their servants, who hoped to make themselves
useful by mixing with the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The journey was most trying. They spent the night
at Fix. The next morning, on arriving at Le Puy, my
mother requested to be immediately conducted to the
‘Département.’ ‘I respect orders coming from the administration,’
she said to the commissary, ‘as much as
I detest those coming from elsewhere.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The entrance into the town was perilous; a few days
previously a prisoner had been massacred on his way
through the suburbs. My mother said to my sister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>‘If your father knew you were here, how anxious he
would be; but at the same time what pleasure your conduct
would give him.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The prisoners arrived without injury, although several
stones were thrown into the carriage. They alighted at
the ‘Département,’ the members of which had been immediately
convoked. As soon as the sitting began, my
mother said that she placed herself with confidence
under the protection of the ‘Département,’ because in it
she beheld the authority of the people, which she always
respected wherever it could be found.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You receive, Messieurs,’ she added, ‘your orders
from M. Roland or from whomsoever you please. As for
me, I only choose to receive them from you, and I give
myself up as your prisoner.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“She then requested my father’s letters should be
copied before they were sent to Paris, observing that
falsehoods were often brought before the Assembly;
she asked leave to read these letters aloud. Some one
having expressed the fear that doing so might be painful
to her. ‘On the contrary,’ she replied, ‘I find support
and comfort in the feelings they contain.’ She
was listened to at first with interest, then with deep
emotion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After having read the letters and looked over the
copies, she begged not to leave the house of the ‘Département’
as long as she remained at Le Puy. She exposed
the injustice of her detention, how useless and perilous a
journey to Paris would be, and concluded by saying that
if they persisted in keeping her as a hostage, she would
be much obliged to the ‘Département,’ were she allowed
to make Chavaniac her prison, and in that case she
offered her parole not to leave it. It was decided in the
next sitting that the ‘Département’ should present her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>request to the minister. While awaiting the reply, the
prisoners were to inhabit the building belonging to the
administration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“While in prison, my mother received touching marks
of sympathy. She was often watched by friendly
National Guards, who would ask to be employed on that
duty in order to prevent its being entrusted to evil-disposed
keepers. She sometimes received accounts of my
brother, who still remained in the same place of refuge;
and of me, for she had thought fit to have me also concealed
at a few leagues from Chavaniac.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At this time public affairs were most inauspicious.
All honest officials took favorable opportunities for
resigning, and were replaced by Jacobins. We learnt
that my father, instead of being set free, had been delivered
up by the coalition to the king of Prussia, and was
on his way to Spandau. The impression produced on
my mother by this news was dreadful. She was in
despair at having given her parole to stay at Chavaniac;
for notwithstanding the impossibility of leaving France,
she could not bear the thoughts of pledging her word to
give up seeking every means of rejoining my father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. Roland’s answer came at the end of September.
He allowed my mother to return to Chavaniac, a prisoner
on parole, under the responsibility of the ‘administration.’
My mother thus received the permission she
had asked for at the precise moment when she was struck
with dismay by the situation my father was in, and by
the dangers he was running now at the hands of foreign
powers, as lately at those of the revolutionists at home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The ‘Département’ decided that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>commune</em></span> would
each day supply six men to guard my mother, who went
to the assembly-room immediately on hearing of this
resolution.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“‘I here declare, gentlemen,’ she said, ‘that I will not
give the parole I offered if guards are to be placed at my
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Choose between these two securities. I cannot be
offended by your not trusting me, for my husband has
given still better proofs of his patriotism than I have of
my honesty; but you will allow me to believe in my own
integrity, and not to add bayonets to my parole.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was decided that no guard should be set, and
that the municipality would every fortnight report my
mother’s presence at Chavaniac. My mother, on learning
that M. Roland had expressed his disapprobation of
the massacres of September, and that he alone could
free her from the <a id='corr202.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='engagment'>engagement</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_202.14'><ins class='correction' title='engagment'>engagement</ins></a></span> she had contracted decided,
notwithstanding her reluctance, on writing to him the
following letter:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I can only attribute to a kind feeling the
change you have brought about in my situation. You
have spared me the dangers of a too perilous journey,
and consented that my place of retirement should be my
prison. But any prison whatever has become insupportable
to me since I learnt that my husband has been
transferred from town to town by the enemies of France,
who were conducting him to Spandau. However repugnant
to my feelings it may be to owe anything to men
who have shown themselves the enemies and accusers of
him whom I revere and love as I ought to do, it is in all
the frankness of my heart that I vow eternal gratitude
to whoever will enable me to join my husband, by taking
all responsibility from the ‘administration,’ and by
giving me back my parole, if in the event of France
becoming more free it were possible to travel without
danger.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“‘It is on my knees, if necessary, that I implore this
favor; imagine by that the state I am in.</p>

<div class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Noailles La Fayette.</span>’</div>
<p class='c024'>“M. Roland thus answered:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I have put, madam, your touching request under the
eyes of the committee. I must nevertheless observe that
it would seem to me imprudent for a person bearing
your name to travel through France, on account of the
unpleasant impression which is at the present moment
attached to it. But circumstances may alter. I advise
you to wait, and I shall be the first to seize a favorable
opportunity.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother answered him immediately as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I return you thanks, sir, for the ray of hope with
which you have brightened my heart, so long unaccustomed
to that feeling. Nothing can add to what I owe
to my parole and to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>administrateurs</em></span> who rely upon
it. No degree of misfortune could ever make me think
of breaking my word, but your letter renders that duty
a little more supportable, and I already begin to feel
something of that gratitude I promised you if, delivered
through your hands, I were restored to the object of my
affections, and to the happiness of offering him some
consolation.</p>

<div class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Noailles La Fayette.</span>’</div>

<p class='c024'>“Three months had elapsed since we had heard anything
about my father. The public papers had announced
his transfer to Wessel instead of Spandau: since then
they had been silent. My mother wrote an unsealed
letter to the Duke of Brunswick, entreating the generalissimo
of the allied troops to send her some news of her
husband through the French army.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She also wrote thus to the king of Prussia:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: Your Majesty’s well-known integrity admits of
M. de La Fayette’s wife addressing herself to you without
forgetting what she owes to her husband’s character.
I have always hoped, sir, that Your Majesty would respect
virtue wherever it was to be found, and thereby
give to Europe a glorious example. It is now five long,
dreadful months since I last heard anything of M. de La
Fayette, so I cannot plead his cause. But it seems to me
that both his enemies and myself speak eloquently in
his favor: they by their crimes, I by the violence of my
despair. They prove his virtue, and how much he is
feared by the wicked; I show how worthy he is of being
loved. They make it a necessity for Your Majesty’s
glory not to have an object of persecution in common
with them. Shall I myself be fortunate enough to give
you the occasion of restoring me to life by delivering
him?</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Allow me, sir, to indulge in that hope as in the one
of soon owing to you this deep debt of gratitude.</p>

<div class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Noailles La Fayette.</span>’</div>

<p class='c024'>“In December M. Roland obtained from the committee
the repeal of the order for my mother’s arrest. She was
still under the surveillance to which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ci-devant</em></span> nobles
were subjected, and could not leave the department without
express permission. But she was disengaged from
her promise, and she was not discouraged. Pecuniary
interests also detained my mother in France, not on her
own account nor on that of her children, but because
she looked upon it as a sacred duty before leaving the
country to see the rights of my father’s creditors acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The events of the 31st of May, which assured the
triumph of the terrorist party, brought no alteration at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>first in our situation, but took from us all hopes for the
future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Towards the middle of June my mother received,
through the minister of the United States, two letters
from my father, written from the dungeon of Magdebourg.
The anxiety they occasioned with respect to my
father’s health marred the joy we felt in receiving
them....</p>

<p class='c010'>“At that period of the Revolution, many <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>émigrés’</em></span>
wives thought it necessary, for the preservation of their
children’s fortune and for their personal safety, to obtain
a divorce. My mother esteemed and even respected the
virtue of several persons who thought themselves obliged
to take this step. But as for herself, the scruples of her
conscience would not have allowed her to save her life by
feigning an act contrary to Christian law, even when no
one could be deceived. However, another motive influenced
her, though this one would have sufficed. Her love
for my father made her find pleasure in all that was a
remembrance of him. Whilst many pious and tender
wives sought for safety in a pretended divorce, never
did she address a request to any administration whatever,
or present a petition, without feeling satisfaction in
beginning everything she wrote by these words: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La
Femme La Fayette</em></span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 21st of <em>Brumaire</em> [Nov. 12] my mother received
the intelligence that she was to be arrested on
the following day. She kept this news from us till the
next morning. The hours passed away in cruel expectation.
M. Granchier, commissary of the Revolutionary
Committee, arrived at the château in the evening of the
same day, with a detachment of the National Guard of
Paulhaguet. We all collected in my mother’s room,
where the order of the Committee for her arrest was read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>aloud. She presented the certificate of civism given her
by the <em>commune</em>. M. Granchier answered that it was
too old, and that it was of no use, not having been countersigned
by the Committee.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Citoyen,’ my sister then asked, ‘are daughters prevented
from following their mother?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yes, mademoiselle,’ answered the commissary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She insisted, adding that, being sixteen, she was
included in the law. He seemed moved, but changed
the subject. My mother kept up everybody’s courage.
She tried to persuade us that the separation would not
be a long one.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The jail at Brioude was already full. The newly
arrived prisoners were, nevertheless, crammed into it.
My mother found herself in the midst of all the ladies
of the nobility, with whom she had had no intercourse
since the Revolution. At first they were impertinent, but
they soon shared in the admiration my mother inspired
in all those who approached her. The society of the
prison was divided into <em>coteries</em>, which cordially hated
each other; but for my mother every one professed
attachment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother soon became aware that she could do
nothing for her deliverance, and that, to escape greater
misfortunes, her best plan was to avoid attracting attention.
One day she ventured to suggest the necessity of
giving more air to a sick woman confined in a small room
with eleven other people. This brought down on her a
volley of abuse impossible to describe. My mother was
happy to find place in a room which served as a passageway,
and where three <em>bourgeoises</em> of Brioude were already
established. By these persons she was received in a
very touching manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The news my mother received at that time from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Paris caused her most painful agitation. My grandmother
and my aunt de Noailles were put under arrest in
their own house, at the Hôtel de Noailles. We had occasional
opportunities of communicating with my mother.
We used to send her clean linen every week. The list was
sewn on the parcel, and each time we wrote on the back
of the page, which nobody ever thought of unsewing.
She would answer us in the same way. But this mode
of correspondence was not safe enough to be employed
in giving any other details than those concerning our
health.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The innkeeper’s daughter, a child of thirteen, sometimes
managed, when carrying the prisoners’ dinner, to
approach my mother. Blows, abuse of language, all was
indifferent to that courageous girl, so that she could succeed
in beholding my mother, and in letting us know
that she was in good health.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the course of January [1794] we found out that
it was not impossible to bribe the jailer and to gain
admission into the prison. M. Frestel (my brother’s
tutor) undertook the negotiation, which was not without
danger. He succeeded. It was settled that he would
take one of us every fortnight to Brioude. My sister
was the first to go. She started on horseback in the
night, remained the whole of the following day with the
good <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>aubergiste</em></span>, who was devoted to us, and spent the
night with my mother. But when daylight came, they
were obliged to tear themselves from each other. My
sister brought back joy in the midst of us with the details
of this happy meeting. We had, each in our turn,
the same satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s health bore up as well as her fortitude.
She was the comfort of those who surrounded her, ever
seeking to be of service to her companions. Thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>she might be useful to some infirm women, she proposed
to them to have their meals with her. She contrived to
persuade them that they were contributing to the common
expense, when nearly all the cost fell upon herself.
She also cooked for them. The prison life was most
wearisome. The room in which she slept with five or
six people was only separated by a screen from the
public passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother soon became plunged in the deepest affliction.
She learned that my grandmother, my aunt, and
the Maréchale de Noailles, my grandfather’s mother, had
been transferred to the Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Towards the end of May the order to convey my
mother to the prison of La Force, in Paris, reached Brioude.
You may fancy our despair when we received our
mother’s letter. The messenger had been delayed, and it
was to be feared that she was no longer at Brioude. M.
Frestel set off immediately. He was bearer of all the
small jewelry possessed by the members of the household,
who had given them to be sold in order to avoid my
mother being conveyed in a cart from brigade to brigade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On arriving at Brioude, M. Frestel obtained a delay
of twenty-four hours. We soon joined him at the prison.
We found my mother in a room by herself, but fetters
were placed near the pallet upon which she had thrown
herself to seek a little repose. The violence of my sister’s
despair was fearful to witness. Owing to M. Frestel’s
entreaties, she obtained leave from my mother to
follow her, and to accompany him in order to implore
the aid of the American minister. She remained only
a short time at the prison, and left us to go to Le Puy
for the purpose of obtaining a permit to travel out of the
department. She was to join my mother on the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My brother and I remained in the horrible room in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>which my mother was confined. We all three offered
up our prayers to God. At twelve o’clock M. Gissaguer
entered the room and said it was time to depart. My
mother gave her last instructions to George and to myself,
and made us promise to seek and to seize upon every
means of joining my father. She grieved at seeing us
undergo so young such cruel misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sister passed that day at Le Puy. In spite of
innumerable obstacles she succeeded in seeing the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>citoyen</em></span>
Guyardin. She conjured him to have an inquiry made
with respect to my mother’s conduct and to forward it
to Paris. He did not move, remained seated at his bureau,
and continued writing, while she was addressing
him in the most urgent manner. He refused to read a
letter from my mother handed to him by Anastasie,
saying that he could not trouble himself about a prisoner
who was summoned to Paris, and adding most vulgar
jokes to his refusal. My unfortunate sister left the room
in a most violent state of despair and indignation. The
cruel Guyardin did not grant her the necessary permission
to travel out of the department and to follow my mother’s
carriage, and my poor sister, in despair, was obliged to let
M. Frestel set off without her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother arrived in Paris on the 19th of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Prairial</em></span>,
three days before the decree of the 22d, which organized
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>une terreur dans la Terreur</em></span>. At that time no less than
sixty people were daily falling victims of the Revolutionary
Tribunal. All seemed to forebode approaching
death to my mother. You may fancy the anguish of
mind in which we spent the two months which followed
my mother’s departure for Paris. We were daily expecting
to hear of the greatest misfortune which could befall
us. Towards that time the château of Chavaniac and the
furniture were sold.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“The peasants of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>commune</em></span> brought us with hearty
good will all that was necessary for our subsistence. Every
day it was reported that my aunt and my sister were to be
sent to the prison of Brioude, whilst my brother and myself
were to be taken to the hospital. As for my mother,
the life she was leading at La Petite Force was dreadful.
At the end of a fortnight my mother was transferred to
Le Plesis. This building, formerly a college where my
father had been educated, had been turned into a prison.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Since the law of the 22d of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Prairial</em></span>, the Revolutionary
Tribunal sent each day sixty persons to the scaffold.
One of the buildings of Le Plesis served as a depot to the
Conciergerie, so every morning twenty prisoners could be
seen departing for the guillotine. ‘The thought of soon
being one of the victims,’ my mother wrote, ‘makes one
endure such a sight with more firmness.’ Twice she fancied
that she was being called to take her place amongst
the victims.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother passed forty days at La Force and Le
Plesis, expecting death at every moment. In the midst
of the tumult caused by the revolution of the 10th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Thermidor</em></span>,
it was for a moment believed that fresh massacres
would take place in the prisons; but soon afterward the
news of Robespierre’s death reached the captives, and it
became known to them that the executions of the Revolutionary
Tribunal had ceased. My mother’s first thought
was to send to the Luxembourg. The jailer’s answer
revealed to her the fearful truth. My grandmother, with
my aunt de Noailles and the Maréchale de Noailles had
been sent to the scaffold on the 4th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Thermidor</em></span>: the three
generations perished together. How can I give you an
idea of my mother’s despair? ‘Return thanks to God,’
she wrote to us later, ‘for having preserved my strength,
my life, my reason; do not regret that you were far from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>me. God kept me from revolting against Him, but for a
long time I could not have borne the slightest appearance
of human comfort.’”</p>

<p>BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Madame La Fayette in her “Life of the Duchesse
d’Ayen” gives the following interesting though painful
particulars regarding the execution of her mother, grandmother,
and sister:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother and my sister were put under arrest in
the first days of October, but allowed to remain well
guarded at the Hôtel de Noailles. A month later I
myself was taken as a prisoner to Brioude, and it became
still more difficult to correspond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Persecutions went on increasing. One day the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>detenus</em></span>
had to answer questions on their actions and on their
thoughts. My mother and my sister were prepared, and
answered those who questioned them with their usual
tact and straightforwardness. The inventory of all that
was in their possession was drawn up. My mother, fearing
she might be made to swear that she had concealed
nothing, had hung to her side, in the shape of a watch
chain, all the diamonds which were left her. They were
not taken; she sold them that same day to a jeweller,
who gave her immediately the money she required to
pay the small debts which were owing, but she never
received the full amount of what was due her, the jeweller
having been beheaded on the following day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing in the world was now left them, save some
few trifles of my sister’s, which were sold, and what
belonged to M. Grellet (tutor to my sister’s children),
who had given them all he possessed. This extreme
poverty and all its consequences are hardly worth mentioning
in the midst of so many other and greater trials.
Each day brought some new misfortune or some fresh
disaster. My father not being able to obtain satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>certificates of residence, was obliged to leave his family
and return to Switzerland, where he had been living for
some time for his health. My father’s men of business
had all been arrested. It was soon the turn of the members
of ‘Parlement,’ and M. de Saron, my mother’s brother-in-law,
was executed on Easter Sunday, 1794.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For some time past even women had not been spared.
Yet my mother and my sister were far from thinking that
their personal safety was threatened; their hearts were,
however, prepared, and they had asked M. Carrichon if
he would have the courage to accompany them to the
foot of the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last, in the month of May, they were ordered to
quit the Hôtel de Noailles; and, after having been led
through Paris from prison door to prison door, they were
at last conducted with the Maréchale de Noailles (my
father’s mother) to the Luxembourg. On arriving there
my mother’s courage did not fail her, and she was much
calmer than she had been for a long time past.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The care my grandmother required occupied them
incessantly. Notwithstanding all the misfortunes which
were falling on her at once, my mother forgot none of
those who were dear to her. It was M. Grellet who
broke to her the news of my arrival in the prisons of
Paris; she cruelly felt this fresh misfortune, and succeeded
in sending me prudent advice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last, after having seen falling around her nearly
all the victims who had been heaped into the same
prison, as well as those who were dearest to her, she was
summoned with her mother-in-law and daughter to the
Conciergerie, that is to say, to death. They arrived at
the Conciergerie worn out with fatigue. M. Grellet had
repaired to a café next to the gate, and succeeded in
exchanging a few words with my sister.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“Deprived of everything, they had barely sufficient
money to obtain a glass of currant water. The persons
who shared their cell prepared a single miserable bed
for the three prisoners. My mother was dejected, and
could not yet believe that so great a crime was possible.
She stretched herself on the pallet, and entreated my
sister to lie down by her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame de Noailles refused to lie down, saying that
she had too short a time to live for it to be worth while
to take that trouble. Her mother passed part of the night
in trying to persuade her to do so. ‘Think,’ she said,
‘of what we shall have to go through to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Ah, mamma!’ my sister answered, ‘what need have
we to rest on the eve of eternity?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“She asked for a prayer-book and a light, by which
she was enabled to read. She prayed during the whole
night. She interrupted herself occasionally to attend to
her grandmother, who slept for several hours at different
intervals, and who, each time she woke, would read over
and over again her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>acte d’accusation</em></span>, repeating to herself:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No; I cannot be condemned for a conspiracy which
I have never heard of; I shall defend my cause before
the judges in such a manner that they will be obliged to
acquit me.’ She thought of her dress, and feared that
it might be tumbled; she settled her cap, and could not
believe that, for her, that day was to be the last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next morning, my mother, somewhat rested, saw
more clearly the doom which awaited her, showed great
courage, spoke tenderly of her grandchildren, and begged
of the prisoners who were present to take charge of her
watch for them. ‘It is the last thing I can send them,’
she said. She took some chocolate with the Madames de
Boufflers (relations of M. de La Fayette), and was afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>summoned to the horrible tribunal. I have been
told that my sister, whilst dressing my mother, seemed
still to find happiness in attending upon her. She was
heard to say, ‘Courage, mamma, it is only one hour
more!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sister, the Vicomtesse de Noailles, entreated the
prisoners to send to her children an empty pocket-book,
a portrait, and some hair. But she was told that such a
mission would endanger the persons who occupied the
room. The name of her sister, Madame de La Fayette,
was pronounced in that fearful abode. She imposed
silence for fear of putting me in danger. She made no
attempt to seek repose. Her eyes remained opened to
contemplate that heaven into which she was about to
enter. Her face reflected the serenity of her soul. The
idea of immortality supported her courage. Never was
so much calm witnessed in such a place. But she would
forget everything to be of use to her mother and grandmother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nine o’clock struck. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Huissiers</em></span> carried off their
victims; tears were shed by those who had only known
them for twelve hours. The mothers made some arrangements
for the event of an acquittal. But my sister, who
did not doubt of the doom which awaited them, thanked
Madame Lavet (one of their fellow-prisoners), with that
charming manner which was in her a gift of nature, expressed
all her gratitude for her kind attentions, and
added, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Votre figure est heureuse; vous ne périrez pas</em></span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. Grellet, who the day before had been confined in
a cell for three hours on account of the interest he had
evinced for the prisoners, having been released as by a
miracle, repaired to M. Carrichon. This good priest, as
well as M. Brun, obtained from Heaven strength enough
to follow the prisoners on the way from the Conciergerie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to the scaffold; there my sister recognized M. Carrichon,
and, with a presence of mind sublime at such a moment,
she pointed him out to my mother, who appeared agitated,
but who collected all her courage, and received fresh
strength by the grace of absolution. From that moment
till the last, her thoughts were no longer on earthly
things; and during the three-quarters of an hour she
had to wait at the foot of the scaffold, she did not cease
to pray with fervor and resignation. MM. Brun and
Carrichon remained till all was over. I feel that the
thought of following in footsteps so dear would have
taken from the horror of so awful an end.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE dreadful scenes of the French Revolution send a
chill of horror to our souls as we read of them, but
we realize with more painful clearness the direful deeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of those bloody days when some eye-witness of those
awful, heart-rending times pictures for us some individual
doom and some particular scene. The following narrative
of the death of Mesdames d’Ayen and de Noailles
by M. Carrichon, priest of the congregation of the Oratory,
will give a most vivid idea of the sufferings of these
women, who, with Madame de La Fayette, must be
classed amongst the most illustrious heroines of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Maréchale de Noailles, the Duchesse d’Ayen, her
daughter-in-law, and the Vicomtesse de Noailles, her
granddaughter, were detained prisoners in their own
house from November, 1793, till April, 1794. The first
I only knew by sight, but was well acquainted with the
two others, whom I generally visited once a week.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Terror and crime were increasing together; victims
were becoming more numerous. One day, as the ladies
were exhorting each other to prepare for death, I said to
them, as by foresight: ‘If you go to the scaffold, and if
God gives me strength to do so, I shall accompany you.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“They took me at my word, and eagerly exclaimed:
‘Will you promise to do so?’ For one moment I hesitated;
‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘and so that you may easily recognize
me, I will wear a dark blue coat and a red waistcoat.’
After that they often reminded me of my promise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the month of April, 1794, during Easter week,
they were all three conveyed to the Luxembourg. I had
frequent accounts of them through M. Grellet, whose
delicate attentions and zealous services were of such
service both to them and to their children. I was often
reminded of my promise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 27th of June, on a Monday or a Friday, he
came to beg of me to fulfil the engagement I had taken
with the Maréchal de Mouchy and his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“I went to the Palais de Justice, and succeeded in
entering the court. I stood very near, with my eyes fixed
upon them during a quarter of an hour. M. and Madame
de Mouchy, whom I had only seen once at their own
house, and whom I knew better than they knew me,
could not distinguish me in the crowd. God inspired me,
and with His help I did all I could for them. The Maréchal
was singularly edifying, and prayed aloud with all
his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The day before, on leaving the Luxembourg, he had
said to those who had given him marks of sympathy:
‘At seventeen years of age I entered the breach for my
king; at seventy-seven I mount the scaffold for my God;
my friends, I am not to be pitied.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I avoid details which would become interminable.
That day I thought it useless to go as far as the guillotine;
besides, my courage failed me. This was ominous
for the fulfilment of the promise I had made to their
relations, who were thrown into the deepest affliction by
this catastrophe. They had all been confined in the
same prison, and had thus been of great comfort to each
other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could say much about the numerous and dismal
processions which preceded or followed that of the 27th,
and which were happy or miserable according to the
state of mind of those who composed them; sad they
always were, even when every exterior sign denoted resignation,
and promised a Christian death; but truly
heart-rending when the doomed victims had none of
these feelings, and seemed about to pass from the sufferings
of this world to those of the next.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 22d of July, 1794, on a Tuesday, between
eight and ten o’clock in the morning, I was just going
out. I heard a knock. I opened the door and saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Noailles children with their tutor, M. Grellet. The children
were cheerful, as is usually the case at that age, but
under their merriment was concealed a sadness of heart
caused by their recent losses and by their fears for the
future. The tutor looked sad, careworn, pale, and haggard.
‘Let us go to your study,’ he said, ‘and leave the
children in this room.’ We did so. He threw himself on
a chair. ‘All is over, my friend,’ he said; ‘the ladies are
before the Revolutionary Tribunal. I summon you to
keep your word. I shall take the boys to Vincennes to
see little Euphémie [their sister]. While in the wood I
shall prepare these unfortunate children for their terrible
loss.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Although I had long been prepared for this news, I
was greatly shocked. The frightful situation of the
parents, of the children, of their worthy tutor, that
youthful mirth so soon to be followed by such misery,
poor little Euphémie, then only four years old,—all these
thoughts rushed upon my mind. But I soon recovered
myself, and after a few questions and answers full of
mournful details, I said to M. Grellet, ‘You must go
now, and I must change my dress. What a task I have
before me! pray that God may give me strength to accomplish
it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We rose, and found the children innocently amusing
themselves, looking gay and happy. The sight of them,
the thought of their unconsciousness of what they were
so soon to learn, and of the interview which would follow
with their little sister, rendered the contrast more
striking, and almost broke my heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Left alone after their departure, I felt terrified and
exhausted. ‘My God, have pity on them and on me!’ I
exclaimed. I changed my clothes and went to two or
three places. With a heavy load on my heart, I turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>my steps towards the Palais de Justice, between one and
two o’clock in the afternoon. I tried to get in, but found
it impossible. I made inquiries of a person who had just
left the tribunal. I still doubted the truth of the news
which had been told me. But the answer destroyed all
illusion and all hope; I could doubt no longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Once more I went on my way and turned my steps
towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. What thoughts,
what agitation, what secret terrors distracted my poor
brain! I opened my heart to a friend whom I could
trust, and who, speaking to me in God’s name, strengthened
my courage. At his house I took some coffee, which
seemed to relieve my head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thoughtful and irresolute, I slowly retraced my steps
towards the Palais de Justice, dreading to get there, and
hoping not to find those whom I was seeking. I arrived
before five o’clock. There were no signs of departure.
Sick at heart, I ascended the steps of the Sainte Chapelle;
then I walked into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>grande salle</em></span>, and wandered about.
I sat down, I rose again, but spoke to no one. From
time to time I cast a melancholy glance towards the
courtyard, to see if there were any signs of departure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My constant thought was that in two hours, perhaps
in one, they would be no more. I cannot say how overwhelmed
I was by that idea, which has affected me
through life on all such occasions, and they have only
been too frequent. While a prey to these mournful
feelings, never did an hour appear to me so long or so
short as the one which elapsed between five and six
o’clock on that day. Conflicting thoughts were incessantly
crossing my mind, which made me suddenly pass
from the illusions of vain hope to fears, alas! too well
founded.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SENTENCED TO THE GUILLOTINE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“At last I saw, by a movement in the crowd, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>prison door was on the point of being opened. I went
down and placed myself near the outer gate, as for the
previous fortnight it had become impossible to enter the
prison yard. The first cart was filled with prisoners,
and came towards me. It was occupied by eight ladies,
whose demeanor was most admirable. Of these, seven
were unknown to me. The last, who was very near me,
was the Maréchale de Noailles. A transient ray of hope
crossed my mind when I saw that her daughter-in-law
and her granddaughter were not with her; but alas!
they were in the second cart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame de Noailles was in white; she did not appear
more than twenty-four years of age; Madame d’Ayen, who
looked about forty, wore a dress striped blue and white.
Six men got in after them. I was pleased to see the
respectful distance at which the two first placed themselves
so as to leave more liberty to the ladies. They
were scarcely seated when the mother became the object
of that tender solicitude for which her daughter was
well known.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard it said near me, ‘Look at that young one!
how anxious she seems! See how she is speaking to the
other one!’ For my part I felt as if I heard all they
were saying: ‘Mamma, he is not there.’ ‘Look again.’
‘Nothing escapes me; I assure you, mamma, he is not
there.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“They had evidently forgotten that I had sent them
word that it would be impossible for me to gain admittance
into the prison yard. The first cart stopped before me
during at least a quarter of an hour. It moved on; the
second followed. I approached the ladies; they did not
see me. I went again into the Palais de Justice, and
then a long way round, and stood at the entrance of the
Pont-au-Change, in a prominent place. Madame de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Noailles cast her eyes around her; she passed and did
not see me. I followed the carts over the bridge, and
thus kept near the ladies, though separated from them
by the crowd. Madame de Noailles, still looking for
me, did not perceive me. Madame d’Ayen’s anxiety became
visible on her countenance. Her daughter watched
the crowd with increasing attention, but in vain. I felt
tempted to turn back. ‘Have I not done all that I
could?’ I inwardly exclaimed. ‘Everywhere the crowd
will be greater; it is useless to go any farther.’ I was
on the point of giving up the attempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suddenly the sky became overclouded; thunder was
heard in the distance; I made a fresh effort. A short
cut brought me, before the arrival of the carts, to the Rue
Saint-Antoine, nearly opposite the too famous Force. At
that moment the storm broke forth. The wind blew violently;
flashes of lightning and claps of thunder followed
in rapid succession; the rain poured down in torrents.
I took shelter at a shop door. The spot is always present
to my memory, and I have never passed it by since
without emotion. In one moment the street was cleared;
the crowd had taken refuge in the shops and gateways.
There was less order in the procession, both the escort
and the carts having quickened their pace. They were
close to the Petit Saint-Antoine, and I was still undecided.
The first cart passed. By a precipitous and involuntary
movement I quitted the shop door, rushed
towards the second cart, and found myself close to the
ladies. Madame de Noailles perceived me, and smiling,
seemed to say, ‘There you are at last? How happy we
are to see you! How we have looked for you! Mamma,
there he is.’ Madame d’Ayen appeared to revive. As for
myself, all irresolution vanished from my mind. By the
grace of God I felt possessed of extraordinary courage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Soaked with rain and perspiration, I continued to walk
by them. On the steps of the church of Saint-Louis I
met a friend, who, filled with respect and attachment for
the ladies, was endeavoring to give them the same assistance.
His countenance, his attitude, showed what he
felt. I placed my hand on his shoulder, and shuddering,
said, ‘Good evening, my dear friend.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The storm was at its height. The wind blew tempestuously,
and greatly annoyed the ladies in the first
cart, more especially the Maréchale de Noailles. With
her hands tied behind her, with no support for her back,
she tottered on the wretched plank upon which she was
placed. Her large cap fell back and exposed to view
some gray hairs. Immediately a number of people who
were gathered there notwithstanding the rain, having
recognized her, she became the sole object of their attention.
They added by their insults to the sufferings she
was enduring so patiently. ‘There she is,’ they cried,
‘that Maréchale who used to go about with so many
attendants, driving in such fine coaches; there she is in
the cart just like the others.’ The shouts continued, the
sky became darker, the rain fell heavier still. We were
close to the cross-road preceding the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
I went forward, examined the spot, and said
to myself, ‘This is the place for granting them what
they so much long for.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cart was going slower. I turned towards the
ladies and made a sign which Madame de Noailles understood
perfectly. ‘Mamma, M. Carrichon is going to give
us absolution,’ she evidently whispered. They piously
bowed their heads with a look of repentance, contrition,
and hope. Then I lifted up my hand, and without uncovering
my head, pronounced the form of absolution
and the words which follow it very distinctly and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>supernatural attention. Never shall I forget the expression
of their faces. From that moment the storm abated,
the rain diminished, and seemed only to have fallen for
the furtherance of our wishes. I offered up my thanks
to God, and so did, I am sure, these pious women.
Their exterior appearance spoke contentment, security,
and joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As we advanced through the ‘Faubourg,’ the rain
having ceased, a curious multitude again lined the two
sides of the street, insulting the ladies in the first cart,
but above all the Maréchale. Nothing was said to the
others. I sometimes walked by the side of the carts and
sometimes preceded them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last we reached the fatal spot. I cannot describe
what I felt. What a moment! what a separation! what
an affliction for the children, husbands, sisters, relations,
and friends who are to survive those beloved ones in this
valley of tears! There they are before me full of health,
and in one moment I shall see them no more. What
anguish! yet not without deep consolation at beholding
them so resigned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We came in sight of the scaffold. The carts stopped,
and were immediately surrounded by the soldiers. A
ring of numerous spectators was soon formed, most of
whom were laughing and amusing themselves at the
horrible sight. It was dreadful to be amongst them!</p>

<p class='c010'>“While the executioners and his two assistants were
helping the prisoners out of the first cart, Madame de
Noailles’ eyes sought for me in the crowd. She caught
sight of me. What a wonderful expression there was in
her face! Sometimes raised towards heaven, sometimes
lowered towards earth, her eyes so animated, so
gentle, so expressive, so heavenly, were often fixed on me
in a manner which would have attracted notice if those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>around me had had time for observation. I pulled my
hat over my eyes, without taking them off her. I felt
as if I could hear her say: ‘Our sacrifice is accomplished!
we have the firm and comforting hope that a
merciful God is calling us to Him. How many dear to
us we leave behind! but we shall forget no one. Farewell
to them and thanks to you! Jesus Christ who died
for us is our strength; may we die in Him! Farewell!
May we all meet again in heaven!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is impossible to give an idea of the animation and
fervor of those signs, the eloquence of which was so
touching that the bystanders exclaimed: ‘Oh, that young
woman, how happy she seems! how she looks up to
heaven! how she is praying! But what is the use of it
all?’ And then, on second thoughts, ‘Oh, the rascals!
the bigots!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The mother and daughter took a last farewell of each
other and descended from the cart. As for me, the outer
world disappeared for a moment. At once broken-hearted
and comforted, I could only return thanks to God for not
having waited for this moment to give them absolution,
or, which would have been still worse, delayed it till
they had ascended the scaffold. We could not have
joined in prayer while I gave and they received this
great blessing as we had been enabled to do in the most
favorable circumstances possible at such a time. I left the
spot where I was standing and went over to the other
side while the victims were getting out. I found myself
opposite the wooden steps which led to the scaffold. An
old man, tall and straight, with white hair and a good-natured
countenance, was leaning against it. I was told
he was a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fermier-general</em></span>. Near him stood a very edifying
lady whom I did not know. Then came the Maréchale
de Noailles exactly opposite me, dressed in black,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>for she was still in mourning for her husband. She was
sitting on a block of wood or stone which happened to
be there, her large eyes fixed with a vacant look. I had
not omitted to do for her what I had done for so many,
and in particular for the Maréchal and Maréchale de
Mouchy. All the others were drawn up in two lines
looking towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From where I stood I could only perceive Madame
d’Ayen, whose attitude and countenance expressed the
most sublime, unaffected, and devout resignation. She
seemed only occupied with the sacrifice she was about
to make to God through the merits of the Saviour, his
divine Son. She looked as she was wont to do when she
had the happiness of approaching the altar for holy communion.
I shall never forget the impression she made
on me at that moment. It is often in my thoughts. God
grant that I may profit by it!</p>

<p class='c010'>The Maréchale de Noailles was the third person who
ascended the scaffold. The upper part of her dress had
to be cut away in order to uncover her throat. I was
impatient to leave the place, but yet I wished to drink
the cup of bitterness to the dregs and to keep my promise,
as God was giving me strength to do so, even in the
midst of my shuddering horror. Six ladies followed;
Madame d’Ayen was the tenth. How happy she seemed
to die before her daughter! The executioner tore off
her cap. As it was fastened with a pin which he had
forgotten to remove, he pulled her hair violently; and
the pain he caused was visible on her countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The mother disappeared; the daughter took her place.
What a sight to behold that young creature, all in white,
looking still younger than she really was, like a gentle
lamb going to the slaughter! I fancied I was witnessing
the martyrdom of one of the young virgins or holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>women whom we read of in the history of the Church.
What had happened to the mother also happened to her;
the same pain in the removal of the cap; then the same
composure and the same death. Oh, the abundant crimson
stream that gushed from the head and neck! ‘How
happy she is now!’ I thought, as the body was thrown
into the frightful coffin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would appear that Madame de Noailles, as well as
her mother, had exhorted her fellow-victims, and amongst
them a young man whom she heard blaspheming. As
she was ascending the scaffold, she turned towards him
and said, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>En grâce, Monsieur, dites, “Pardon.”</em></span>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“May Almighty God in his mercy bestow on the members
of that family all the blessings which I ask and
entreat them to ask for mine! May we all be saved
with those who have gone before us to that happy dwelling
where revolutions are unknown; to that abode
which, according to the words of Saint Augustine, has
Truth for its king, Charity for its law, and will endure
for Eternity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once more we return to the account of Virginie La
Fayette, Marquise de Lasteyrie:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“For some time after the 10th of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Thermidor</em></span>, the prisoners
still considered themselves as being between life
and death. The massacres had ceased; but they might
be renewed. My mother received frequent visits from
M. Carrichon, the holy priest who had accompanied my
grandmother and my aunt to the foot of the scaffold,
who had given them absolution, and had witnessed their
sacrifice. You can imagine all she felt on hearing the
admirable details he gave her of the last moments of
those angelic women.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meanwhile, the endeavors to obtain my mother’s release
were incessant. The American minister continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>indefatigable in his exertions. At last the members of
the Committee gave an order for her release.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s first care was to go and thank M.
Monroe for all he had done in her behalf.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was six days after she had left prison that George
joined my mother, who had sent for him. My mother
longed to see my sister and me, but she would not leave
Paris before having obtained for my brother a passport
for America. Knowing that my father’s wish would be
to send him to the United States, she did not hesitate to
make the sacrifice of separating herself from George.
M. Frestel was to accompany him. My mother wrote
the following letter to General Washington:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I send you my son. It is with the deepest and
most sincere confidence that I put my dear child under
the protection of the United States, which he has ever
been accustomed to look upon as his second country, and
which I myself have always considered as being our
future home under the special protection of their President,
with whose feelings towards his father I am well
acquainted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘My wish is that my son should lead a very secluded
life in America, that he should resume his studies, interrupted
by three years of misfortunes, and that, far from
the land where so many events are taking place which
might either dishearten or revolt him, he may become
fit to fulfil the duties of a citizen of the United States,
whose feelings and whose principles will always agree
with those of a French citizen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I shall not say anything here of my own position,
nor of the one which interests me still more than mine.
I rely upon the bearer of this letter to interpret the
feelings of my heart, too sorrowful to express any others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>but those of the gratitude I owe to MM. Monroe, Skypwith,
and Mountflorence, for their kindness and their
useful endeavors in my behalf.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I beg M. Washington will accept the assurance, etc.</p>

<div class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Noailles La Fayette.</span>’</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“It can easily be imagined how cruelly my mother
suffered on separating herself from her son, and on sending
him, at fourteen, alone, amongst strangers, two thousand
leagues off. But such would have been my father’s
wish, and she found strength in that thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother, after bidding farewell to George, had
nothing more to keep her in Paris. She started for
Auvergne. We went to meet her. You may fancy the
ecstasy of our joy on seeing her. At last my mother’s
passport was granted. She had provided for everything.
All her actions, all her thoughts since my father’s departure
had tended to find the means of joining him. It
was after many difficulties and anxieties that we arrived
at Vienna. The old Prince de Rosemberg, grand chamberlain,
was moved by her appeal, and obtained for her
an audience of the emperor, unknown to his ministers.
We accompanied her. She was received with politeness,
and simply asked permission to share my father’s captivity.
The emperor answered: ‘I grant it to you; as for
his liberty, that would be impossible; my hands are tied.’
To the expression of her gratitude for the favor she had
just obtained, my mother added that the wives of my
father’s friends imprisoned with him at Olmütz would
envy her happiness. He replied: ‘They have only to
act like you. I shall do the same for them.’ My mother
said that she had heard of several vexations in use in
the Prussian prisons, and she begged the emperor to
allow her to address herself directly to him for the requests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>she might have to make. He answered: ‘I consent.
But you will find M. de La Layette well fed and
well treated. I hope you will do me justice. Your
presence will give him fresh satisfaction. Anyhow, you
will be pleased with the commanding officer. In jail the
prisoners are only distinguished by their numbers, but
as for your husband, his name is well known.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother left the audience-chamber, in an ecstasy
of joy. She was obliged to pass a week more in Vienna,
to hasten the despatch of the order which was to give
her admittance into the prison. At last, after many
delays, the order for admitting my mother into the
prison of Olmütz was delivered to her by Ferraris,
minister of war. He told her at the same time that he
thought it his duty to advise her to reflect on the course
she was taking, to warn her that she would be most
uncomfortable, and that the prison life she was going to
lead might have serious consequences for her and for
her daughters. My mother did not even listen to him,
and we set off immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We arrived on the second day after our departure, at
eleven o’clock in the morning. Never shall I forget the
moment when the post-boy pointed out to us in the distance
the steeples of Olmütz. My mother’s emotion is
still present to my mind. She was for some time choked
with tears, but, as soon as she recovered the power of
speech, she blessed God by these words of Tobit’s
prayer:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Blessed be God that liveth forever, and blessed be
His kingdom, for He doth scourge and hath mercy; He
leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again; neither is
there any that can avoid His hand. Confess Him before
the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for He hath scattered
us among them. There declare his greatness, and extol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Him before all the living; for He is our Lord, and He
is the God our Father forever. And He will scourge us
for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will
gather us out of all nations, among whom He has scattered
us. Therefore see what He will do with you, and
confess Him with your whole mouth, and praise the
Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. Let my
soul bless God the great King.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We drove to the house of the commander of the
town. He sent the officer in charge of the prison to
conduct us. After having been admitted through the
first door, which was locked on the guard itself, we arrived,
by passing through several long passages, to the
two padlocked doors of my father’s room. My father
had not been informed of our arrival. Three years of
captivity, the last of which had been passed in complete
solitude,—for, since the attempt at escape, he had not
even seen his servant,—continual anxiety with respect
to all the objects of his affection, sufferings of every
kind, had deeply impaired his health; he was fearfully
altered. My mother was struck with the change, but
nothing could diminish the rapture of her joy, save the
bitterness of her irreparable losses. My father, after
the first moment of happiness caused by this unexpected
meeting, dared not make any inquiries. He knew there
had been a reign of terror in France, but he had not
learned the names of the victims. The day passed without
his venturing to ask any question; my mother had
not courage enough to break the subject herself. It was
only in the evening, after we had been locked in an adjoining
but separate room, which had been assigned to
my sister and myself, that she told my father that her
grandmother, her mother, and her sister had perished
on the scaffold.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Madame La Fayette wrote thus to her aunt, when reunited
to her husband:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks to your good advice, dear aunt, I have attained
my wishes. If I had been known, I could never
have entered the Austrian dominions; and if I had not
kept very quiet at Vienna until M. de Rosemberg had
arranged my audience, I should never have succeeded.
The emperor very politely granted us permission to be
imprisoned with M. de La Fayette, and said at the same
time that the affair was very complicated, and did not
depend on him alone; but he assured us he should be
well treated, and that our presence <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>serait un agrément de
plus</em></span>.... Fancy the feelings of M. de La Fayette, who
for eighteen months had not been permitted to learn
even if we existed, and who had seen no one but his
jailers, when, without any preparation, we entered his
room....</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you like to know the sort of life we lead here?
At eight o’clock the jailers call us to breakfast, after
which I am locked up with my little girls till midday.
We all dine together, and the turnkey comes in twice, to
take away the dishes, and to bring in supper. We are
all together until eight o’clock, when they carry off my
little girls to their cage. The keys of their room are
always delivered to the commandant, and they are locked
in with all sorts of absurd precautions. We three pay
for our food out of my money. We have more than we
can eat, but inexpressibly dirty.... It is a great blessing
to us both that the children keep well in this unwholesome
place. My own health is not very good ...
but nothing to make me uneasy. Of course you feel that
nothing could induce us to leave M. de La Fayette. His
health is really improved since our arrival. His terrible
emaciation and pallor are the same, though both his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>keepers and himself assure me that they are nothing like
what they were a year ago. But no one can go through
four years of such captivity with impunity. I have not
been able to see his fellow-captives, Messieurs de Maubourg
and de Pusy, nor even to hear their voices; from
the age one of their late keepers supposed them to be
they must have grown terribly older.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know the details of our captivity at Olmütz,”
writes Virginie; “my mother shared in all its hardships.
We had not the slightest intercourse with the outside.
The doors were only opened for the officer’s visit at meal
time. We were refused a woman for household work.
On entering the prison we were asked for our purses, and
three silver forks found in our luggage were seized. The
use of a knife and fork was refused us, and we were
obliged, during the whole time, to eat with our fingers.
My mother applied to the authorities on all these subjects,
but all her requests were refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother deeply felt the grief of being unable to
alleviate the sufferings of her companions in captivity.
But as for herself, no words could express her happiness.
You can only imagine it by remembering what was the
ruling passion of her life from the age of fourteen, and
how much she had gone through from frequent separations
and incessant labors which had so constantly called
my father from his home, as from the great dangers to
which he had been exposed. She had passed three horrible
years almost without a hope of ever seeing him
again. At last she possessed that happiness which, during
all her life, she had been longing for; each day she
beheld the influence of her presence on my father’s health,
and the solace she afforded him; she was surprised at
feeling so happy, and reproached herself for being satisfied
with her situation while my father was still a prisoner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>She was allowed now and then to write, under
the eyes of the officer on duty, short unsealed letters
to the banker, who remitted the money necessary for
our food. Permission to write to her son was refused,
in order that no intelligence from the prison of Olmütz
should reach the United States. It was with a toothpick
and a small piece of India ink that she wrote my
grandmother’s life on the margins of the engravings of a
volume of Buffon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As might have been expected, my mother’s health
had suffered much. Never did she show more meritorious
submission to my father’s wishes than when
she determined to write to the emperor for permission
to go and consult the doctors at Vienna. At the end of
seven weeks the commander of Olmütz came to intimate
a verbal refusal to leave the prison unless she
gave up all hopes of returning. He asked at the same
time for a written answer. It was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The commander of Olmütz having declared to me
that, on my request to go for a week to Vienna in order
to consult the doctors, his Imperial Majesty does not permit
me under any pretence whatever to go to Vienna,
and only allows me to leave this prison on condition
never to enter it again, I have the honor here to renew
my answer. It was my duty towards my family and
friends to try and obtain the advice necessary for my
health, but they well know that I cannot accept the conditions
offered to me. I cannot forget that while we
were both on the eve of perishing, I through the tyranny
of Robespierre, M. de La Fayette through the physical
and moral sufferings of his captivity, I was neither
allowed to receive any accounts of him, nor to let him
know that his children and I were still alive. I shall
not expose myself to the horrors of another separation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“‘Therefore, whatever may be the state of my health,
or the hardships of this abode for my daughters, we
shall all three take advantage of his Imperial Majesty’s
goodness in allowing us to share this captivity in all its
details.</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Noailles La Fayette.</span>’</div>
<p class='c024'>“My mother’s illness made rapid progress. The
doctor was only allowed to see her a moment during
the officer’s visit. Being ignorant of the French
language he could not understand her, but would express
in Latin his fears to my father. This state lasted
eleven months, during which no alleviation of the prison
treatment was obtained. She had not even an armchair.
Her sufferings did not in the least impair her
spirits. Seeing her always serene, always enjoying my
father’s company, and the consolations she had brought
with her, we were all less anxious than we ought to
have been.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sister supplied the place of outdoor workmen;
she even made shoes for my father. But her principal
occupation was to write under his dictation on the margins
of a book. My mother attended to my education,
and used to read with me; but the margins of a book,
the toothpicks, and the bit of India ink were things
too precious for my use. In the evening my father used
to read aloud to us: I still remember the pleasure of
those moments.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the interior of the prison we had established a
correspondence with our companions in captivity, with
the help of the soldiers, whom we bribed by the pleasure
of a good meal. Of a night, through our double bars, we
used to lower, at the end of a string, a parcel with part
of our supper, to the sentry on duty under our windows,
who would pass the packet in the same manner to MM. de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Maubourg and de Pusy, who occupied separate parts of
the prison.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the month of July, 1797, the Marquis de Chasteler,
Austrian general, was sent by the emperor to
Olmütz, in order to offer their liberty to the prisoners on
condition that they would promise never again to appear
in his dominions. The day they received this proposal
they heard that the French government, who insisted
on their deliverance, had declared at the same time
that they could not return to France. Notwithstanding
this proof of ill-will, the three friends, who had been
allowed to meet a moment in order to consult together
on their decision, refused to make any agreement which
did not preserve entire the rights of their country on
their persons; this restriction caused the prison doors
to be closed on them again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The following was La Fayette’s declaration in answer
to the offer of liberty upon conditions which he considered
too ignoble to comply with:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Olmütz</span>, July 25, 1797.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The commission with which the Marquis de Chasteler
is entrusted appears to me to reduce itself to three
points: First, His Imperial Majesty wishes to have a
statement of our situation at Olmütz. I am disposed to
present no complaint to him. Several details will be
found in my wife’s letters transmitted or sent back by
the Austrian government, and should his Imperial Majesty
not consider it sufficient to re-peruse the instructions
sent from Vienna in his name, I will willingly furnish
the Marquis de Chasteler with all the information he
may desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Secondly, His Majesty the emperor wishes to be
assured that immediately after my liberation I shall set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>out for America. That intention I have often expressed,
but as an answer would, under present circumstances,
appear like an acknowledgment of the right to impose
on me such a condition, I think it inexpedient to comply
with the demand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thirdly, His Majesty the emperor and king has
done me the honor to announce to me that, as the principles
which I profess are incompatible with the safety
to the Austrian government, he cannot consent to my
return to his states without his special permission.
There are certain duties, the fulfilment of which I cannot
decline; I have some towards the United States; I
have others towards France,—I cannot under any circumstances
shrink from the performance of those which
I owe to my country. With this reservation I can
assure General the Marquis de Chasteler of my fixed
determination never to set foot in any state subject to
his Imperial Majesty the King of Bohemia and Hungary.</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Regarding this brave action of the Marquis de La
Fayette, who had been languishing for five years in his
loathsome prison, but who would not purchase liberty at
the sacrifice of one iota of his avowed rights and principles,
his daughter Virginie says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother fully appreciated this noble conduct. In
the midst of her sufferings she would willingly have
paid with many months of captivity the pleasure caused
her by my father’s declaration in answer to the proposals
made by the Austrian government. Two months elapsed
before we received any new communication. At last
General Bonaparte and General Clarke, the French plenipotentiaries,
required that the prisoners of Olmütz
should be delivered without further delay.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“After many difficulties, the order was forwarded to
open the gates of the citadel to the prisoners of Olmütz.
We set off for Hamburg on the 19th of September, 1797.
Five years and one month had elapsed since my father’s
arrest, and twenty-three months since we had joined him.
At Dresden, Leipsic, Halle, and Hamburg our journey
was a prolonged triumph. Crowds thronged to see my
father and his companions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately upon his release from prison La Fayette’s
first care was to thank M. de Talleyrand, and to write the
following letter to General Bonaparte:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Hamburg</span>, Oct. 6, 1797.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Citoyen Général</span>: The prisoners of Olmütz, happy
to owe their deliverance to your irresistible arms, had,
during their captivity, rejoiced at the thought that their
liberty and their life were attached to the victories of
the republic and to your personal glory. It is with the
utmost satisfaction that they now do homage to their
liberator. We should have liked, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Citoyen Général</em></span>, to have
offered to you in person the expression of these feelings,
to have witnessed with our own eyes the scenes of so
many victories, the army which has won them, and the
general who has placed our resurrection amongst the
miracles he has accomplished. But you know that the
journey to Hamburg has not been left to our choice.
From the place where we took leave of our jailers we
address our thanks to their victor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the solitary retreat on the Danish territory of
Holstein, where we shall try to recover our health, we
shall unite our patriotic wishes for the republic with the
most lively interest in the illustrious general to whom
we are still more attached on account of the services he
has rendered to the cause of liberty and to our country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>than for the special obligation we rejoice in owing to
him, and which the deepest gratitude has forever engraved
in our hearts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c024'>Among the letters which greatly gratified La Fayette
upon his liberation was the following from Madame de
Staël, addressed to him when it was announced that he
was to be delivered.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>June 20, 1797.</span></div>

<p class='c010'>“I hope this letter will reach you. I should like to
be one of the first to tell you of the feelings of indignation,
grief, hope, fear, anxiety, discouragement, with which
your fate has filled, during these last five years, the hearts
of all those who love you. I do not know whether it is
possible to make these cruel recollections bearable to you;
nevertheless, I may say, that, while calumny was destroying
every reputation, while faction, unable to triumph
over the cause, was attacking every individual, your misfortunes
have preserved your glory; and if your health
can be restored to you, you come out whole from a tomb
where your name has acquired fresh lustre.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come directly to France; there is no other country
for you. You will find that republic which your opinions
led you to wish for when your conscience bound you
to royalty. You will find it illustrated by victory and
free from the crimes which stained its origin. You will
uphold that republic, because without it no liberty can
exist in France, and because, as a hero and as a martyr,
you are so united with freedom that I pronounce your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>name and the name of liberty at the same moment to
express what I wish for the honor and welfare of France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come to France; there you will find devoted friends;
and let me hope that my constant care for your welfare
and my useless efforts to serve you may entitle me to a
small place in your thoughts.”</p>

<p>MADAME DE STAËL.<br /><span class='small'>[FROM THE PORTRAIT GALLERY OF EMINENT MEN AND WOMEN.]</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>During La Fayette’s long imprisonment many persons
in England, France, and America interested themselves
in efforts in his behalf. Of these one of the most indefatigable
was Joseph Masclet, a man of rare merits.
During the Reign of Terror he went to England to save
his life. He was not personally acquainted with La Fayette,
having never even seen him at that time, but he
warmly sympathized with his principles and admired
his sterling virtues. He constantly wrote against the
detention of La Fayette, and published numerous articles
in the Hamburg journals upon the subject, using the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>nom-de-plume</em></span> of “Eleutheros,” the Greek for freeman. It
was in vain that the Austrian cabinet took every measure
to discover “Eleutheros,” though several emissaries were
sent to London to find the unknown person who thus
dared to brave the anger of the Austrian government.
Masclet was supported in England in these philanthropic
efforts in behalf of La Fayette and his companions in
misfortune, Generals Latour-Maubourg and Bureaux de
Pusy, who were imprisoned with him in Olmütz, by
Fox, Wilberforce, Sheridan, and at their head General
Fitzpatrick and General Tarleton, who had fought
against La Fayette in Virginia; but these now all united
to plead with the Pitt ministry and the calumniators
of La Fayette. In December, 1796, General Fitzpatrick
made that eloquent speech in the English House of
Commons, in behalf of the prisoners at Olmütz, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>produced great sensation in Europe, which ended as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“That an humble address be presented to his Majesty,
that it appears to this House that the detention of Generals
La Fayette, Bureaux de Pusy, and Latour-Maubourg,
in the prison of his Majesty’s ally, the emperor of Germany,
is highly injurious to his Imperial Majesty and to
the common cause of all the allies; and humbly implore
his Majesty to intercede in such manner as to his wisdom
shall seem proper for the deliverance of these unfortunate
persons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The friendship between La Fayette and Masclet continued
strong until the death of the latter. Immediately
upon La Fayette’s release from Olmütz, he addressed
the following letter to the faithful “Eleutheros,” who
had been untiring in his efforts in his behalf.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Witmold</span>, 9th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Brumaire</em></span>, year 6.</div>

<p class='c010'>“How is it possible, my dear friend, that since the
period of our deliverance you have not yet received the
homage of my gratitude, and the expression of my sincere
friendship? M—— must have explained to you that
my delay in writing could have proceeded only from the
hope of enjoying a happiness still greater. I am far
from renouncing that happiness; I have need of it more
than ever, and I demand it from you with the feeling of
confidence which you have given me a right to express.
I am not apprehensive of abusing that right, and it is
gratifying to me to use it. I forbear to speak of my
obligations towards you, my dear friend; the question
relates to more than my own liberty and my own life,
since my wife, my daughters, my two friends, and our
faithful domestics have been restored along with me.
How many other obligations to which my heart is incessantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>alive should I not still have to recapitulate, were
I to endeavor to portray my gratitude! but it is inexpressible—inexhaustible—like
your friendship, and I
should feel delighted to thank you by pressing you to my
heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have had news of our deliverance, of our journey,
of our health; that of my wife in particular is so
bad that we have been forced to stop in the nearest place
of safety. To have embarked even for a short voyage
would have caused great injury to some of our party.
Travelling by land, after the first eight days, would have
been uncertain, and my wife would have been unable to
bear it without undergoing a degree of fatigue that would
have been dangerous in her exhausted situation. We
therefore propose to settle for some time in a very isolated
retreat between Kiel and Ploën. That territory is
subject to the king of Denmark, and his connection with
the Republic will, I trust, prevent him from molesting
French citizens whose principles may be displeasing
to him, but whose only occupation will consist in the
care of their health, and who, unfortunately, in their
present position, can serve liberty only by their wishes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have doubtless been made acquainted with my
opinion on the events of the 18th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Fructidor</em></span>, and I am
aware that my opinion on that subject is not yours.
Perhaps mine is influenced by my profound contempt for
the counter-revolutionists, and by some regret at not
having gone out at a moment when liberty of opinion
and a bad tone of society would, it is said, have authorized
a republican declaration. But I cannot deceive
myself as to the nature of the measures that have been
taken; as to the constitution that has been sworn, and
which, by the way, is infinitely better than that which
I was to have defended; as to the personal characters

of rights, which, waiving all considerations of an author’s
self-love, shall always form the rule of my opinions and

been confirmed by experience, that Liberty can, and ought
to be, assisted only by means worthy of her. If I deceive
myself in my disapprobation of some of the present
measures, the fault is not mine; I have been enabled to
form a judgment on them only by means of some apologies
and public papers; and in frankly laying before you

existed, I most ardently desire to hear from you the

<p class='c010'>“Our first act of liberty at Hamburg was an act of
respect to the representative of the Republic, an account
of which he must have forwarded to the government.
We have written to Bonaparte in the midst of his triumphs,
and to Clarke in the midst of his reverses, for
both have considerable claims upon our gratitude. But
as it appears to us that the official tribute ought to be
addressed to the minister of foreign relations, the first
organ of the government in taking steps which have
released us from captivity and death, we have written to
Talleyrand, as the natural depository of our acknowledgments,
as the individual to whom we owe an account
of our existence in a foreign country, and as joining to
his ministerial claims that which he possesses upon our
personal gratitude. We trust that by these three steps
taken by us at Hamburg, in Italy, and at Paris, we have
fulfilled all suitable duties and formalities. The pleasure
of our deliverance is augmented beyond measure by the
idea that we owe it to the triumphs of the Republic, to
the kind feelings of our fellow-citizens, and to the zeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of our best friends, among whom you are acquainted
with one whose abilities are as superior as his heart is
excellent, one for whom I feel the most affectionate
regard, whom I ardently long to embrace, to whom I have
a thousand things to say, and a thousand questions to
put, and whom I shall cordially cherish till my latest
breath.</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In 1792 Madame La Fayette had written to Washington
in behalf of her husband, as follows: “While he
suffers this inconceivable persecution from the enemies
without, the faction which reigns within keeps me a
hostage at one hundred and twenty leagues from the
capital. Judge, then, at what distance I am from him.
In this abyss of misery, the idea of owing to the United
States and to Washington the life and liberty of M. de
La Fayette kindles a ray of hope in my heart. I hope
everything from the goodness of the people with whom
he has set an example of that liberty of which he is now
made the victim. And shall I dare speak what I hope?
I would ask of them, through you, for an envoy, who
shall go to reclaim him in the name of the republic of
the United States, wheresoever he may be found, and
who shall be authorized to make, with the power in
whose charge he may be placed, all necessary engagements
for his relief, and for taking him to the United
States, even if he is there to be guarded as a captive.
I hope my request is not a rash one. Accept the homage
of the sentiments which have dictated this letter, as well
as that of attachment and tender respect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Trying as it was for Washington to refuse this request
in his public capacity, as he felt he could not make an
official demand which might involve his country in embarrassments;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>he did all that he could as a private individual
in his friend’s behalf, and to the emperor of Germany
he thus wrote:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will readily occur to your Majesty that occasions
may sometimes exist, on which official considerations
would constrain the chief of a nation to be silent and
passive, in relation even to objects which affect his sensibility
and claim his interposition as a man. Finding
myself precisely in this situation at present, I take the
liberty of writing this private letter to your Majesty,
being persuaded that my motives will also be my apology
for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In common with the people of this country, I retain
a strong and cordial sense of the services rendered to
them by the Marquis de La Fayette, and my friendship
for him has been constant and sincere. It is natural,
therefore, that I should sympathize with him and his
family in their misfortunes, and endeavor to mitigate
the calamities which they experience; among which, his
present confinement is not the least distressing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I forbear to enlarge upon this delicate subject. Permit
me only to submit to your Majesty’s consideration
whether his long imprisonment and the confiscation of
his estates, and the indigence and dispersion of his family,
and the painful anxieties incident to all these circumstances,
do not form an assemblage of sufferings
which recommend him to the mediation of humanity!
Allow me, sir, on this occasion to be its organ, and to
entreat that he may be permitted to come to this country
on such conditions and under such restrictions as your
Majesty may think it expedient to prescribe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As it is a maxim with me not to ask what, under
similar circumstances, I would not grant, your Majesty
will do me the justice to believe that this request appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to me to correspond to those great principles of
magnanimity and wisdom which form the basis of sound
policy and durable glory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May the Almighty and Merciful Sovereign of the
universe keep your Majesty under his protection and
guidance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To Gouverneur Morris, who had superseded Mr. Monroe
as minister to France, Madame de Staël wrote urgently
in behalf of La Fayette. She says in one of her
letters to Mr. Morris:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are travelling through Germany, and, whether
on a public mission or not, you have influence, for they
are not so stupid as not to consult a man like you. Open
the prison doors of M. de La Fayette. Pay the debt of
your country. What greater service can any one render
to his native land than to discharge her obligations of
gratitude? Is there any severer calamity than that
which has befallen La Fayette? Does any more glaring
injustice attract the attention of Europe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Morris not only spared no sacrifice for the marquis,
but aided his suffering family, and was chiefly instrumental
in securing the liberation of Madame La Fayette.
But for five long years Prussia and Austria defended
their infamous conduct by declaring “that La Fayette’s
freedom was incompatible with the safety of the present
governments of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Latour-Maubourg, in a letter written during
their imprisonment at Olmütz, thus graphically describes
their prison life:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not suppose that I have made a mistake in lodging
the domestic from Paris in two chambers which are
large, handsome, and the best in the enclosure, whilst
General and Madame La Fayette have but two small
cells, their daughters but a narrow kennel, with a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>wretched bed; and whilst Pusy and myself, in addition
to the common inconveniences, have those attached
to the neighborhood of the guard-house and out-houses,
the dampness of which is such, that the wall touching
them is covered with saltpetre. The genius of the
imperial administration has thought of everything that
can render our seclusion complete, and harass us in the
slightest matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The waters with which we are surrounded furnish, in
addition to a multitude of flies that are extremely
troublesome, frequent fogs, which occasion dangerous
fevers, and to which the town of Olmütz owes its reputation
for unwholesomeness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Besides, the gutters passing beneath our windows
always emit an insufferable stench, and exhale a mephitic
vapor that is absolutely pestilential. Our prisons,
without excepting even that of the ladies, are furnished
with a sorry bed without curtains, two deal tables, two
chairs, a range of wooden pegs, a wardrobe, and a stove
which is lighted from the outside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hitherto, you perceive that we have had none of the
conveniences promised by the emperor to Madame La
Fayette. It is probably a great honor to be his Majesty’s
guest, particularly in a prison: but the thing is really
no laughing matter. The breakfast is of chocolate, or
coffee with milk, at the prisoner’s option, and both are
execrable, as you may well imagine when you are informed
that they are made by a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>vivandière</em></span>, in a small
kitchen, into which the soldiers from the barracks enter
at pleasure, and where their whole time is spent in smoking.
It thus happens that everything eaten by us is
impregnated with a strong savor of tobacco, and we are
even fortunate when we do not find large pieces of that
weed in what is given to us. Our dinner is served up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>deep earthenware dishes; and with regard to cleanliness,
as everything comes from the kitchen of the same <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>vivandière</em></span>,
whose execrable ragouts, rancid butter, and spices
I might forgive, were she herself less dirty. To fill up
the measure of disgust, everything—meat, soup, vegetables,
fricassees—must be eaten with a pewter spoon,
without knife or fork, and had we not brought napkins
along with us, some fragment of which still remain, the
sleeves of our coats must have served for that purpose.
Two pint jugs are brought to us full, one of coarse, flat,
red wine, the other of dirty water, and we must drink out
of both, because, as it was explained to me, ‘the emperor
chooses it.’ You will conceive, the disgust inspired by
these jugs, when I add that when removed from our
chambers they are placed in the windows of the corridor,
where they are exposed to insects, dust, tobacco smoke,
and what is still worse, left for the use of the soldiers,
who drink out of them and perform their ablutions in
them. They are cleaned only at stated periods, at the
beginning and in the middle of each month, with a wisp
of straw.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From these details you will perceive that, as a relief
from our vexations, which are the more annoying as
they have not even the semblance of necessity; and to
diminish the tedious length of the days, we have no other
resource than reading. In Silesia we had been allowed
the use of paper, pen, and ink; but at the mention of
this our jailers were greatly astonished, and bestowed
contemptuous epithets on the want of intelligence displayed
by the Prussians in tormenting their victims.
We were deprived even of the letters which we had
received from our relatives and friends, and were informed
that we were separated from the rest of the
world, that we must forget our own names, and recollect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>only our numbers, by which only we were to be known,
and that we should never hear each other spoken of.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ask how we dressed? Like beggars; that is to
say, in rags, since our worn-out clothes have not been
replaced. La Fayette, however, wanted breeches, and I
have been informed that a tailor was ordered, without
taking his measure, to make a large pair of trousers for
him, and a waistcoat of coarse serge, at the same time
informing him that cloth was too dear for him. I believe
that the garment alluded to was purposely made in such
a manner as to prevent him from wearing it, and that
Madame La Fayette supplied the deficiency by purchasing
cloth on some pretext or other. In the articles of
shoes and stockings he is strangely provided, for those
he wears Mademoiselle Anastasie was obliged to make
with her own fair hands, out of the stuff of an old coat.
For my own part, I wear a waistcoat and nankeen trousers
made at Nivelle, nearly five years ago, and you may therefore
judge of the state of maturity at which they have
arrived. Were I to make my appearance in the street,
any charitable soul would offer me alms. Three months
ago, however, I was supplied with new shoes; the old
ones had been soled thirteen times, and for the new
ones I was indebted merely to the obstinacy of the cobbler
who found it utterly impossible to perform the operation
for the fourteenth time. Whilst my shoes were
being made I was obliged to remain in bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding La Fayette’s many privations and
persecutions during his long imprisonment, his moral
courage remained unimpaired. He had been languishing
for five years in a state between life and death. He had
lost all his hair, and had several times been attacked by
dangerous fevers bred by the dampness and infectious
air of his dungeon. In the midst of his many misfortunes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>his coolness and presence of mind never for an
instant deserted him. After his attempt to escape, having
been recaptured and brought back to Olmütz, he was
at first confined in a large apartment, but was soon
afterwards commanded by an officer to pass into an
adjoining room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For what purpose?” asked La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That your irons may be put on,” replied the officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your emperor has not given you such an order,”
boldly exclaimed the illustrious prisoner; “beware of
doing more than he requires, and of displeasing him by
exceeding his orders through an ill-timed zeal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The officer, impressed with the truth and courage of
this remark, insisted no further, and La Fayette was thus
spared from being obliged to endure the humiliating torture
of being ironed during the remainder of his imprisonment.
Neither did his great sufferings break his spirit.
One day the officer on guard, beholding La Fayette at
his meal, and seeing that he was forced to eat with his
fingers, asked him if that mode was entirely new to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh no!” replied La Fayette, with cool irony; “I
have seen it employed in America, amongst the Iroquois.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When La Fayette was first released from his prison at
Olmütz, he found that he had come back to a changed
world. The king, queen, court, Assembly, and constitution,
all were gone! The awful Reign of Terror which
swept over his country had left many empty places
among his friends, and the France which met his ardent
gaze was greatly different from that upon which his
longing eyes turned as he had been obliged to depart
from her coasts in haste and with baffled hopes.</p>

<p>EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Writing to a friend who had cautioned him against
freely expressing his opinions, lest he might find himself
in further trouble, La Fayette boldly answered: “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>risk nothing in speaking as I think, because I would not
and could not be employed by any party except according
to my own ideas. The result is that, except on some
very great occasion of serving the liberty of my country
after my own fashion, my political life is ended. To my
friends I shall be full of life, and to the public a sort of
picture in a museum or book in a library. Those who
know my views and wishes must be convinced that the
services I should wish to render to my country are of a
nature to be combined with the mode of living which suits
my position, my wife, all my family, and myself; that is
to say, with a quiet philosopher’s establishment on a good
farm,—far enough from the capital not to be interfered
with in my solitude, and to see only intimate friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately upon the release of La Fayette, Washington
addressed to him the following letter from Mount
Vernon, dated Oct. 8, 1797:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“This letter will be presented to you, I hope, by your
young son, well worthy of having such parents as yourself
and your amiable wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could say to you much better than I can express it
here all that I have felt for your sufferings; concerning
my efforts for your release, the measures which I adopted,
although without success, to facilitate your deliverance
from an unjust and cruel captivity; and my joy at last
in beholding its termination.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I desire to congratulate you, and be assured that no
one could offer it with an affection more profound and
sincere. Each action of your life gives me a right to
rejoice at the liberty which you have received, and also at
the restoration of security in your country; and if the possession
of these blessings cannot entirely compensate for
the trials which you have endured, they will mitigate, at
least, the painful remembrance.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“The conduct of your son since he landed upon American
soil has been most exemplary, from all accounts, and
has procured for him the affection and the confidence
of all who have had the pleasure of knowing him. His
filial affection, his ardent desire to embrace his parents
and his sisters in the first moment of their deliverance,
have not permitted him to await here more authentic
news; and as nothing has been heard which should influence
him to suspend this resolution, I have not refused
my assent to his departure, that he might fly to the arms
of those who are so dear to him, because, according to
last accounts, he ought, in truth, to find them in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. Frestel has been a devoted guardian to George;
a father could not have watched with greater care over
his cherished son; and he merits in a high degree all
that can be said of his virtues, his good judgment, and
his prudence. Your son and he carry with them the
wishes and the regrets of our family and of all who
know them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At all times be assured you have held a high place
in the affections of this country. I will not tax your
time to speak to you of that which regards me personally,
except to say to you that I have once again retired
to my own fireside, where I will remain, forming wishes
for the prosperity of the United States, after having
labored for years for the establishment of their independence,
of their constitution, and of their laws. Those
wishes will constantly have for their object also the welfare
of all mankind, as long as the little day of my life
upon the earth shall be continued. I have said adieu to
public affairs, and I desire to withdraw entirely from
politics. But M. Frestel and George will report me
more fully upon this point. Although they have always
avoided taking any part in our discussions, they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>not been inattentive spectators of that which has passed
before their eyes. They will give you a general idea of
our situation, and of those parties who, in my opinion,
have troubled the peace and tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If your remembrances or your circumstances shall
bring you on a visit to America, accompanied by your
wife and daughters, not one of its inhabitants will receive
you with more cordiality and tenderness than
Madame Washington and myself. Our hearts are full
of affection and admiration for you and them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the time of La Fayette’s release from Olmütz he
wrote to Masclet the following letter regarding the military
career of his son, George Washington La Fayette,
which is interesting as revealing some of the peculiar
circumstances which surrounded the family at that time,
and also La Fayette’s impressions regarding the state of
France:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Talleyrand and you imagine that had George been in
the army, the Directors, in replying to Brune, would have
made a formal exception in my favor; not more so, perhaps,
than the Convention made in favor of the father of
Moreau, on the day when the latter took the fort of
l’Ecluse. But even supposing that the uniform worn by
all the young aristocrats who seek to connect themselves
with the Republic had produced such an effect upon the
government, you will observe that my son could not have
returned in time to follow Bonaparte, unless I had made
excessive haste to send him; and when my deliverer was
apprehensive of compromising himself by replying to my
letters, when he was himself said to be threatened with
an act of accusation, it would have been imprudent to
send to him the son of a man to whose <em>treasons</em> the Directory
and the President of the Council of Five Hundred
had recently called public attention. Since that period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>you have not regretted the wars of Switzerland for him.
Had he been attached to Championnet, he would probably
have been associated in a criminal trial; had he
served with Joubert, he would have been disgraced,
and would perhaps have participated in the extreme
disgust which that general cannot refrain from expressing;
whereas at present he is free and full of ardor, and
we may examine the question of his entrance into the
service, which has become much more tempting, to use
his own expression, since we have undergone reverses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fact is, that George, who is a republican patriot,—and
I have met with few such in my lifetime,—has,
besides, a passion for the military profession, for which
I think him adapted, as he possesses a sound and calm
judgment, a just perception, a strong local memory, and
will be equally beloved by his superiors, his comrades,
and his subordinates. I love him with too much tenderness
to make any distinction between his desires and
mine; and I am too great an enemy of oppression of
every description to place restraint on the wishes of a
beloved son nearly twenty years of age. I could joyfully
see him covered with honorable scars; but beyond
that supposition I have not the courage to contemplate
existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Other objections, however, present themselves to my
mind. I do not call them insurmountable, for I admit
that the opposite opinion is plausible; and it is only
because it appears indisputable to you that I endeavor to
reduce it to its just value. Let us, in the first place, lay
aside your comparison with my journey to America,
whither I proceeded to oppose the despotism of a government
which had violated fewer natural and social
rights, from the foundation of the colonies to the Declaration
of Independence, than the Directory daily violates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>amongst those who have been subjugated to its power.
We must not be led away by the flattering sounds of
republic and liberty. Algiers, Venice, and Rome under
Tiberius, caused the first name to be heard; and as for
the second, do you think that the young patricians who
demanded of Sylla the honor to introduce Roman liberty
into Asia had more energy than he who said to his governor,
‘Why is not this man killed who disposes of the
life and property of his fellow-citizens?’—‘The reason is
that nobody ventures upon the deed.’—‘Then give me
a sword, and I will kill him.’ That individual, as you
know, was Cato.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no doubt gratifying to serve an ungrateful
country either in one’s own person or in that of a son;
but, in this instance, ingratitude can hardly be said to
exist, since benevolence reappears with liberty; it is a
proscription by the oppressive faction of the country,
which is at present prolonged by an arbitrary government,
till the return of liberty; and for the constant
enemy of despotism, it is not indispensable to serve the
despotic pentarchy of France. There are also particular
inconveniences in my son’s case. You know that in
organized countries—in England, for instance—activity
of service seems to imply the approbation of the governing
party; but without admitting that difficulty, imagine
George at the table of a leader, drinking, three months
hence, to the fortunate day of the 10th of August, which
was the signal for the assassination of our friends, or
ordering one of my accomplices to be shot!</p>

<p class='c010'>“If, at least, some return to liberal ideas should become
manifest,—if I could perceive the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>avant-coureurs</em></span>
of a national and legal government,—the inexpressible
desire which I feel for such a blessing would induce me to
welcome with avidity the smallest drop of liberty that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>might fall from heaven. I cordially detest the ancient
powers; I ardently wish that the new doctrine may be
established upon a firm basis; this coalition is composed
of my implacable enemies. I entertain no personal
hostility towards the present government; I have even
obligations to some of them; and the persecution which
I have suffered is too honorable to me for its avowed
motives to suffer me to be shocked at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know that I love my country, and that its welfare,
in whatever quarter it might originate, would give
me the highest gratification: consequently no bitterness
can enter into the severity of my objections, which
I would instantly waive, were liberty, or even the dawn
of liberty, again perceptible in France; but I have felt
desirous of explaining to you, my dear friend, what has
hitherto prevented me from yielding to the natural ardor
of my son, and what has struck himself in hearing my
remarks on the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the same time I admit that the opposite opinion,
even under existing circumstances, has considerable
weight. France, whether free or not, is still our country,
and there are more germs of liberty in her democratic
organization than could enter into the counter-revolution.
Her adversaries are the decided enemies of
our purest principles, and have taken up arms only to
accomplish her utter destruction. If it appears unsuitable
that, when Europe is divided into two bands, a
young man of nineteen years of age should be found in
neither, it is evident that the place of a patriot—of
my son—can only be under our national standards.
The late reverses have imparted a more defensive character
to our wars, and a leader incapable of acts of
pillage has just been appointed to the army of Italy; in
a word, if it be permitted, or let us even say, if it be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>duty to hesitate, there are many reasons at this moment
for the adoption of your advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At a later period La Fayette wrote to the same friend
to inform him of his son’s departure for Italy:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“I heartily thank you, my dear Masclet, for your
congratulations on the wished-for appointment. The
new-made officer is hastening to the field, and hopes to
embrace you to-morrow, before his and your departure.
Sure it is, the standard of the rights of men is not on
the side against which he is going to fight. May they
be in France the reward of victory!</p>

<p class='c010'>“With sanguine expectations I am waiting for news
from Italy. Bonaparte will conquer. Our situation in
Germany is glorious indeed; a brilliant campaign and
an honorable peace are, I think, to be depended upon.
Adieu, my dear Masclet.</p>

heroic and unselfish life of Madame La Fayette, her
daughter Virginie and her husband are her best biographers.
After their release from Olmütz Virginie La
Fayette thus writes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last, on the 10th of October, 1797, we arrived at
Witmold. From my aunt De Tessé, who owned this property
of Witmold, we received the most tender reception.
Here my mother recovered her strength, and found repose
of body and mind. My father found his friends. He was
fond of Madame de Tessé, and had with her on every point
complete community of opinions. His political life had
met with her constant approbation, and you may fancy
what charm five years of silence at Olmütz added to
Madame de Tessé’s lively, animated, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>piquante</em></span> conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shortly afterwards my brother arrived from Mount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Vernon. Under General Washington’s paternal care he
had become a man. My mother was happy, and so were
her children. My sister often met at that time Charles
de Latour-Maubourg, the younger brother of my father’s
friend. Anastasie was captivated by his handsome countenance,
and the noble feelings he expressed. Their wedding,
celebrated at Madame de Tessé’s, was a fresh link
between two families whose old friendship had been
sealed by misfortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The course of my mother’s convalescence was disturbed
by the imperious necessity of returning to France,
where she was summoned by family business. She alone
could follow up the affairs of the family, for she alone
could return to France, as her name was on none of the
lists of proscription or <em>suspicion</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>During this absence of Madame La Fayette her husband
thus wrote to her from Vianen, near Utrecht. Young
La Fayette had joined the French army in Holland. It
was rather a singular fact that while the father, the illustrious
upholder of the liberties of his country, was unable
to enter his native land, his son was fighting her battles.
While not allowed to return to France, the thoughts of
La Fayette turned yearningly toward America, and he
thus expressed his desires to his wife in a letter written
to her at that time:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yesterday and to-day George and I have been planning
a farm for you, either in the beautiful valley of the
Shenandoah, in the state of Virginia, not far from Federal
City and even Mount Vernon, or in the lovely fields of
New England, within reach of the town of Boston, for
which you know my fancy. I do not conceal from myself,
dear Adrienne, the fact that I, who complain of the serfs
of Holstein as a sad surrounding for a friend of liberty,
should find negro slaves in the valley of the Shenandoah;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>for if in the northern states there is equality for all, in
the southern it exists only for the whites. It is true
that, with our ideas of Cayenne, we might console ourselves
somewhat. I should, however, prefer New England,
and at the same time I feel all the reasons which
ought to draw us near Mount Vernon and the seat of
government. But we only want the first dollar to buy
our farm with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding the painful anxieties which filled his
mind, consequent upon his own uncertain position, La
Fayette was ever keenly alive to the interests of others,
especially of his friends. The following letter was written
by him during his own exile, to the Directory, in
behalf of his friends who had been his companions in
prison:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Citizen Directors</span>: Permit a citizen who owes his
liberation to the government of his country now to avail
himself of that obligation to demand of you an act of justice.
I am not about to speak of myself; and though my
heart and my reason equally remind me of my rights, I
appreciate the circumstances which keep me still at a distance
from my country; but in offering up my prayers
for her liberty, her glory, and her happiness I purpose to
speak to you of the few officers who, on an occasion, the
responsibility of which belongs to me alone, thought themselves
obliged to accompany their general and were made
prisoners by the enemy. Their patriotism, which has been
tried from the beginning of the Revolution, has been preserved
in all its ardor and purity, and the Republic cannot
have more faithful defenders.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>While General La Fayette was at Witmold, just after
his release, he received the following letter from the illustrious
Alexander Hamilton, who, six years after, fell in
the fatal duel with Aaron Burr:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>New York</span>, April 28, 1798.</div>

<p class='c010'>“I have been most happy, my dear Marquis, to receive
at last a letter from you. It confirms that which I had
already learned of your disposition; that though your
engagements have not permitted you to follow the fortunes
of the French Republic, you have never ceased to
be attached to it. I frankly avow that my sentiments on
that point differ from yours. The execution of the king
and the massacres of September have cured all my sympathy
for the French Revolution. I have never believed
that one could make France a republic, and I am convinced
that this attempt, so long as it shall be prolonged,
can only bring misfortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amidst the sad results of this revolution, I regret
extremely the discussions which have arisen between our
countries, and which seem to menace a complete rupture.
It will be useless to retrace the causes of the actual state.
I will only say that the project of alliance with Great
Britain, of which we have been accused, we have not been
a party to, although our adversaries have believed it useful
to their views to report such an opinion in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I give you this assurance upon the strength of our
ancient friendship. The future will prove that my assertion
is true. The basis of the politics of the party to
which I belong is to avoid all intimate or exclusive
relations with any foreign power.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, leaving politics, the rest of my letter will be consecrated
to assuring you that my friendship for you will
survive all revolutions and all vicissitudes. No one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>more than myself realizes how much cause our country
has to love you, to desire your happiness, and to wish to
contribute thereto. As I feel so sensitively for you, I
hope that I shall never show it to you in an equivocal
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the actual state of our relations with France, I
cannot press you to come here, and until a radical change
shall operate in France I shall be grieved to learn that
you have returned there. If a prolongation of this evil
order of things shall be continued in your country, and
shall make you wish to seek elsewhere a permanent asylum,
you can be assured of finding in America a reception
tender and cordial. The only thing in which all our parties
accord is in the affection which they equally feel
towards yourself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The difficulties alluded to by Hamilton between the
United States and France, which almost resulted in open
warfare, were caused by false rumors of an alliance between
Great Britain and the United States, occasioned
by England’s endeavors to draw neutral America into
hostilities with France, regarding the liberty of commerce.
To this letter La Fayette sent the following
reply:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Witmold</span>, Aug. 12, 1798.</div>

<p class='c010'>“Your letter of the 28th of April caused me much
happiness, my dear Hamilton. You speak to me with a
touching friendship of the warm reception which awaits
me in America, but you cannot, you say, press me to
hasten my departure under actual circumstances. Truly,
my dear friend, it is much against my desires that I have
been forced to defer it for so long a time. Immediately
upon my deliverance I had wished to embark; but it was
impossible for my wife, in the state of her health, to set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>sail, and I could not resolve to leave her. I have been
waiting until the moment when she could undertake a
journey to France, necessary to our affairs. I wait news
from her. Would that I also might receive that which
shall give me the hope of a reconciliation between the
United States and the French government.</p>

<div id='i330'  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/i-330.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Hamilton</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“You know that if my attachment to my native country
has not been altered, the measures of her governors are
repugnant in general to my sentiments; and in spite of
the obligations which I am under to some of them for
my deliverance, I cannot be considered as their personal
friend. You know, also, that the independence, the dignity,
the prosperity of the United States are more dear
to me than to any one; my opinion ought, then, to have
some weight with you. For I believe, be assured, as far
as I can judge, at this distance where I am, in the best
intentions which the Directory have in this respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Under this supposition, my dear friend, at a moment
when no one power of continental Europe can resist the
French Republic, I believe it conformable to honor and
to the interests of the United States to come half way
toward a reconciliation. Never, and much less since
your declarations, would I be so unjust towards any one
of my best friends as to suppose that the spirit of party
prejudices, or private grievances, could, under such grave
circumstances, influence their conduct. Let America,
so far as she has been wronged, maintain her dignity and
her rights; but if an ancient alliance, which no one could
pretend to regret or improve, can bring itself to her remembrance,
I have confidence that the two parties which divide
the countries will re-unite to effect a reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Since you have spoken to me of the difference of our
opinions upon the European revolution, I would return
to the time when, following that which I have often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>predicted, I found myself engaged in the struggle; up to
August, then, in spite of the offers of a powerful faction,
I believed it to be my duty to resist or to die in remaining
always faithful to my constitutional oath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The passionate love of liberty which took me to
America disposed me naturally to adopt a democratic
and republican system. Afterwards, moved by all the
dangers of royalty and of an English aristocracy, I remembered
also the faults of our previous experiences. I concluded
that the science of a social organization had not
been sufficiently studied, and I desired that it should have
a universal trial. The first principles, however, appeared
to me indubitable. The fundamental doctrines of the
rights of the man and the citizen, reduced to what I
believed to be necessary and sufficient, were proclaimed
by me; and after the national triumph of July 14, 1789,
a civil militia was instituted, to measure itself against
the permanent armies of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very soon after, all ancient abuses, all hereditary
pretensions disappeared. However, an hereditary president
of executive power had been established in the royal
family, and that decision was so conformed to the will of
the people, to the opinions of their representatives, and
to other circumstances, that in the month of June, 1791,
almost an entire majority of our constitutional assembly,
heretofore discontented, thought better to replace upon
the throne a constitutional king, than to complete the
establishment of a republican government. The extent
of the English prerogative was judged inadmissible, particularly
on account of our military situation. If one
believes that a constitutional monarchy, such as ours,
might be modified so that it might gradually arrive at
the adoption of a government entirely elective, such
an inconvenience would be less grievous than that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>usurpations upon the rights of the national sovereignty,
or upon the liberty of citizens. It was after this manner
of viewing affairs, that in the midst of popular outrages,
the intrigues of factions, and the machinations of foreigners,
a constitution was freely discussed and adopted by
the nation. It had faults, truly, but it contained nothing
contrary to the rights of men, and it included means,
lawful and easy, for ameliorations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is against this constitution that the old governments
have united; it is to them, as well as to the Jacobins,
that we must attribute our ruin. Until then, the
excesses so often unpunished had not been official. When
anarchy and the assassin had put down the honest patriot,
the kings had the satisfaction of seeing extinguished all
desire of imitation in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Their hopes of conquest, however, were disappointed.
The National Guard, dismissed from the interior, ran to
the frontiers and fought with an irresistible force for
national independence. During three years the Republic
had been in France but a name tarnished by an extravagant
and sanguinary tyranny. To these misfortunes
succeeded the establishment of a constitution which
was violated on the 18th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Fructidor</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not pretend that France at present enjoys liberty;
but though the first constitution and that of the
year III., preferable on many accounts (in particular
by the establishment of two Chambers), cannot be
considered by me but as secondary objects compared
to the importance of the fundamental doctrine, I am
persuaded that liberty can be consolidated in France
and in other countries, upon the basis of an elective
government, sooner than upon that of hereditary presidents.
This opinion is not only the result of my republican
inclinations; it comes also from the situation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>men and of things. It has been even adopted by many
unpatriotic monarchists who found that the resurrection
of the French monarchy when it became a question
of determining the powers of the king, caused more
trouble than it had advantages.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How in this situation have I not recognized with joy
the American principles of my old friend, that it would
be impolitic to re-establish an hereditary magistracy, the
destruction of which had been illegal, but for which I
had never desired immortality. Wherefore, shall I not
hope that the elective governments, with differences of
form and similarity of principle, could be so combined as
to assure the establishment of a true liberty? Is it then
indispensable to be free to have a king? Will that obligation
necessarily be attached to a vast territory and
people? I do not think so. And so far as the experiment
has been tried I have found that it would be better
to follow the American principles than for us to take the
English method.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this is talking too much of politics, my dear
Hamilton. I have not the pretension to believe that,
upon such a subject, friends who have formed a strong
opinion can persuade the one or the other. I have
wished only to show you the motives for my conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you very tenderly for the earnest and affectionate
manner in which you have expressed the good
wishes of America in my favor, and your own feelings.
I appreciate deeply my obligations towards that well-beloved
country and shall always be ready to give my
life for her prosperity. I am happy and proud of the
sentiments which her virtuous and constant citizens have
preserved, of those of my more intimate companions—of
yours, particularly, my dear Hamilton. I hope that
you are assured that our ancient friendship has not suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>in my heart the least diminution, and that from
the first instant when our fraternal union was formed,
until the last moment of my life, I shall be always your
most devotedly attached friend.”</p>

<p>DIRECTEUR SIÉYÈS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But we will again let Virginie tell the story of her
father’s return to France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“France was far from being in a quiet state. During
the whole summer the country was greatly agitated. The
terrorist party was once more gaining alarming strength.
On different points great advantages had been obtained
by the troops of the Coalition. An English army had
disembarked at the Helder. Terrified at all that was
said in Paris, my mother trembled at the thought of
seeing fresh barriers arising between my father and
herself. Owing to the good will of the Batavian government
he was allowed to remain in Holland, notwithstanding
General Brune’s injunctions to the contrary.
But if my father could not depend on the protection of
the French armies, what would happen if those of the
Coalition marched into Holland, bringing with them the
counter-revolution? My mother, in her anxiety, resolved
to go to the Directeur Sieyès, then chief of the party opposed
to the Jacobins. She told him of the dangers to
which my father was exposed, and warned him that if the
foreign armies were victorious, he would take refuge on
the French territory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sieyès answered that it would be imprudent for him
to return to France, and that he would be safer in the
states of the king of Prussia. ‘Who kept him a prisoner!’
answered my mother. ‘M. de La Fayette would
prefer, if necessary, a prison in France, but he has more
confidence in his fellow-countrymen.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“All was in this alarming uncertainty when the revolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of the 18th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Brumaire</em></span> took place, and changed the
face of affairs. With that just appreciation of things
which never forsook her, my mother at once deemed it
necessary that, without loss of time, and without asking
anybody’s permission, my father should return to France
at the very moment when justice was proclaimed. She
wished him to return ere time had brought the slightest
change, and without any other authorization than the
liberal intentions then proclaimed by the new government.
She obtained a passport for him under an assumed
name, and M. Alexandre Rom&oelig;uf, one of his former aides-de-camp,
brought it to him. My mother was accustomed
to foresee my father’s intentions, to judge with marvellous
tact what it was best for him to do: she would guess his
wishes. He, on his side, had entire confidence in her
opinion. Therefore, without any further delay, he started
immediately and arrived in Paris.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But La Fayette did not sneak into France like a culprit;
he knew his course had been above reproach, and he boldly
announced his arrival to Napoleon in the following manly
note:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the day when the prisoners of Olmütz owed their
liberty to you, to this, when the liberty of my country lays
me under still greater obligations to you, I have thought
that the continuance of my proscription was not expedient
for the government or for myself. Accordingly I am
now in Paris. Before going into the country, where I
shall meet my family,—before even seeing my friends
here,—I delay not a moment to address myself to you;
not that I doubt that I am in my appropriate place wherever
the Republic is founded upon a worthy basis, but
because both my duty and my feelings prompt me to bear
to you in person the expression of my gratitude.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>NAPOLEON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Bonaparte was taken completely by surprise. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“man of the people” had outgeneralled the “conqueror
of Italy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Though he could not outwardly express his dissatisfaction,
his displeasure was made very evident. Virginie
La Fayette says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Premier Consul received this news with a very
bad grace. He would have wished my father to remain
in Holland, and to solicit like everybody else permission
to enter France. The ministers declared that my father
must return to Utrecht, there to wait till his name
should be effaced from the list of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>émigrés</em></span>. Those of our
friends who approached the Premier Consul assured us
that nobody dared for the present say a word to him
on the subject. My mother went to see him and was
graciously received. She explained to General Bonaparte
my father’s peculiar situation, and the effect his return
would produce on the mind of every honest patriot. The
general was struck with the nobleness, prudence, and tact
of her language. ‘I am charmed, Madame,’ he said, ‘to
make your acquaintance; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>vous avez beaucoup d’esprit, mais
vous n’entendez pas les affaires</em></span>.’ Nevertheless, it was decided
that my father should remain openly in France
without asking for any permission, and that he should
go to the country, there to remain during the legal term
of his proscription.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sister and her husband arrived from Holland.
My brother had already joined my father, and we established
ourselves first at Fontenay, then at La Grange, one
of my grandmother’s estates which had fallen to my
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the objects my father had in view on re-entering
France was to facilitate the return of his companions
in exile. Many difficulties were to be conquered. This
task was entrusted to my mother. She was obliged to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>constantly to Paris in order to plead the cause of those
faithful friends. She succeeded; there is not one amongst
them, I believe, who does not owe his radiation to her
personal exertions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The remainder of this precious life was consecrated to
us. Repose would have best suited my father even under
Bonaparte’s consular magistracy, but under Napoleon’s
imperial despotism honor prescribed retirement. The
dearest wish of my mother’s heart was to lead a private
life. If, after so many fatigues and sufferings, quiet had
not been necessary, the possibility of peacefully consecrating
herself to the affections which filled her soul, to
the one especially which surpassed them all, was the only
happiness she could desire. She felt too deeply, too passionately,
I may say, the emotions of family life to wish
for any other. Neither the grandeur of her former position,
nor even the lustre of her misfortunes, had given
birth in her mind to that restless pride which cannot bear
to return to a homely life. Though her devoted courage
had arisen above the greatest trials, still the feelings and
easy duties of an obscure destiny would have sufficed to
satisfy her heart. Love filled her whole being.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God permitted her to enjoy, during the last years of
her life, greater happiness than she had ever ventured to
hope for. My mother’s health was greatly impaired,
but her natural and simple courage acted as a charm to
deceive us. We beheld her always serene and tender,
taking the liveliest part in the happiness caused by the
birth of her three eldest grandchildren. She bore with
gentle fortitude the anxieties of which my brother and
my husband were the objects during the campaigns of
1805 and 1806. She heard with joy of George’s good
fortune when he saved his general’s life at the battle of
Eylau. The peace which followed brought on for her a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>period of unmingled happiness. At the end of the spring of
1807, it seemed that God had accomplished all my mother’s
desires in this world. A few days after the return of my
brother and of my husband, in August, my mother was
taken with violent pains and strong fever. On the 11th
of October she heard mass for the last time in the chapel
of La Grange. The disorder attacked her brain in a most
fearful manner. My mother’s delirium was peculiar and
entirely in keeping with her character; she was completely
absorbed by her affection for those she loved; in
her wanderings she would mistake herself on our situations,
never on our characters: she knew us to the last.
One day she called my sister to her and said: ‘Have you
an idea of what maternal feeling is? Are you like me?
Do you know all its joys? Is there anything sweeter,
deeper, stronger? Do you feel, like me, the want of loving
and of being loved?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her love for God and for my father occupied almost
exclusively her last moments. What she was for my
father in the midst of this delirium is not to be conceived.
The effect his presence produced on her, the
choice of the words she used to express her love, with
more confidence than she had ever shown before; how,
with complete incoherence in her ideas, she followed up
interests which, though imaginary, were in keeping with
her character and her opinions; the charm with which she
spoke to him of God and of religion,—all this cannot be
expressed by words, and such a delirium could only be
hers. ‘God owed her the reward,’ M. de Grammont said
to my father, ‘of permitting her thus to reveal to you the
depth of her tenderness.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the midst of this delirium she repeated three times
over Tobit’s prayer, the same she had recited on seeing
the towers of Olmütz. We lost her on Christmas night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>at twelve o’clock, in the year 1807. It was at the foot
of our Saviour’s cradle that our sacrifice was accomplished.
In the morning she had bestowed her blessing on each of
us. Her last words were, ‘I do not suffer.’ She also
said to us, ‘May the peace of the Lord be with you.’
And to my father, ‘I am entirely yours’ (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je suis toute
à vous</em></span>).”</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Jules Cloquet says in his recollections of La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette had a high regard for the domestic virtues,
which he considered the basis of society and the only certain
and pure source of public prosperity. He even wished
to introduce them into politics; and his public life was
in this respect a picture of his private life. He always
spoke with respect and tenderness of both his parents,
whom he lost almost in his infancy. In his children he
cherished the memory of their mother (Mademoiselle de
Noailles), whom he had loved most tenderly, and whose
name he never mentioned but with visible emotion. One
day during his last illness I surprised him kissing her
portrait, which he always wore suspended to his neck, in
a small gold medallion. Around the portrait were the
words, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je suis à vous</em></span>,’ and on the back was engraved this
short and touching inscription, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je vous fus donc une douce
campagne: eh bien! bénissez moi</em></span>’ (I was then a gentle
companion to you! So then give me your blessing!).</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have since been informed that regularly every morning
La Fayette sent out his valet Bastien, shut himself
up in his room, and taking the portrait in both hands,
looked at it earnestly, pressed it to his lips, and remained
silently contemplating it for about a quarter of
an hour. Nothing was more disagreeable to him than
to be disturbed during this daily homage to the memory
of his virtuous partner.” His grief for her loss may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>judged of from the two following letters written by
him at the time of this overwhelming affliction:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“I was certain, my dear Masclet, that you would tenderly
regret the adorable woman whom you were pleased
to celebrate before you were personally acquainted with
her, and to cherish from the period when she was herself
able to express to you her grateful friendship. It would
be ungrateful in me to entertain a doubt of your participation
in my grief; but although such a doubt was far
from my thoughts, I have derived a melancholy gratification
from the renewed assurance of your feelings, and for
that assurance I thank you most cordially. I willingly
admit that under great misfortunes I have felt myself
superior to the situation in which my friends had the
kindness to sympathize, but at present I have neither the
power nor the wish to struggle against the calamity which
has befallen me, or rather to surmount the deep affliction
which I shall carry with me to the grave. It will be mingled
with the sweetest recollections of the thirty-four
years during which I was bound by the tenderest ties
that perhaps ever existed, and with the thought of her
last moments, in which she heaped upon me such proofs
of her incomparable affection. I cannot describe the happiness
which in the midst of so many vicissitudes and
troubles I have constantly derived from the tender, noble,
and generous feeling ever associated with the interests
which gave animation to my existence. Assure Madame
Masclet of my attachment and gratitude. You know my
friendship for you, my dear Masclet, and that I am yours
most cordially,</p>

<p class='c010'>Letter from M. de La Fayette to M. de Latour-Maubourg,
on the death of Madame de La Fayette:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>January, 1808.</span></div>

<p class='c010'>“I have not yet written to you, my dear friend, from
the depth of misery in which I am plunged. You have
already heard of the angelic end of that incomparable
woman. I feel I must again speak of it to you. My
grieved heart loves to open itself to the most constant,
the dearest confidant of all its thoughts. As yet you
have always found me stronger than circumstance, but
now this event is stronger than me. Never shall I
recover from it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the thirty-four years of an union in which her
tenderness, her goodness, the elevation of her mind,
charmed, adorned, honored my life, I felt myself so
used to all that she was to me, that I could not distinguish
it from my own existence. She was fourteen, and
I was sixteen, when her heart occupied itself with everything
that could interest me. I knew I loved her, I knew
I needed her; but it is only now that I can distinguish
what is left of me for the remainder of a life which I had
thought was to have been entirely devoted to worldly
matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The foreboding of her loss had before never crossed
my mind until I received a note from Madame de Tessé
as I was leaving Chavaniac with George. I was struck
to the heart. On arriving in Paris after a rapid journey,
we found her very ill; there was a slight improvement
the next day, which I attributed to the pleasure of seeing
us; but soon afterwards her head was affected. She
said to Madame de Simiane, ‘I was going to have a
malignant fever, but I shall be well attended to, and shall
get the better of it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was not a malignant fever; but unhappily it was
something still worse. One day only Corvisart had great
hopes. Our dear invalid was already beginning to wander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>when her confessor came to see her. In the evening she
told me: ‘If I go to another dwelling, you know how
much I shall think of you there. Although I shall
leave you with reluctance, the sacrifice of my life would
be little if it could insure your eternal happiness.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The day she received the sacrament she was anxious
to see me near her. Delirium came on afterwards; you
never saw anything so extraordinary and so touching.
Imagine, my dear friend, a mind completely disordered,
thinking itself in Egypt, in Syria, amongst the events of
the reign of Athalie, which Celestine’s lessons had left in
her imagination, strangely blending every idea that was
not from the heart; in short, the most constant delirium,
and withal that kindness which always seeks for something
pleasing to say. There was also a refinement in
the way she expressed herself, a loftiness of thought
which astonished every one. But what was admirable
above all was that tenderness of heart which she was
incessantly showing to her six children, to her sister, to
her aunt, to M. de Tessé: she thought she was with them
at Memphis; for, by a miracle of feeling, her mind was
never invariably fixed but where I was concerned. It
seemed as if that impression was too deep to be obliterated,
was stronger than sickness, stronger than death
itself. Life had already fled; feeling, warmth, existence,
all had taken refuge in the hand which pressed
mine. Perhaps she did even yield to her affection and
her tenderness more completely than if she had had the
full possession of her faculties.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not imagine that the dear angel was alarmed at
the thought of a future world. Her religion was all love
and confidence; the fear of hell never came near her
mind. She did not believe in it for beings good, sincere,
and virtuous, whatever their opinions might be. ‘I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>not know what will happen at the moment of their death,’
she would say; ‘but God will enlighten them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“However, had her mind been clear, she would have
thought of what she called her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>péchés</em></span>, though she did not
believe in any other divine punishment than that of being
deprived of the sight of the Supreme Being.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how often have you heard me joking her about
her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>aimables hérésies</em></span>. Who knows whether the fear of
increasing my regret would not have partly restrained
the outpouring of her feelings, in the same manner as
when, during our married life, her utter unselfishness
prevented her from yielding to what was most impassioned
in her nature? ‘There was a period,’ she said a
few months ago, ‘when, after one of your returns from
America, I felt myself so forcibly attracted to you that I
thought I should faint every time you came into the
room. I was possessed with the fear of annoying you,
and tried to moderate my feelings. You can scarcely be
dissatisfied with what remains.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘What gratitude I owe to God,’ she would repeat during
her illness, ‘that such passionate feelings should have
been a duty. How happy I have been!’ she said the
day of her death. ‘What a lot to be your wife!’ And
when I spoke to her of my tenderness, she answered in a
touching tone: ‘Is it true? Is it indeed true? How good
you are! Repeat it again; it does me so much good to
hear you. If you do not find yourself sufficiently loved,
lay the fault upon God; He has not given me more faculties
than that I love you,’ she said, in the midst of her
delirium, ‘Christianly, humanly, passionately.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“When she was pitied for her sufferings, the fear of
exaggerating them to herself and to others would come
upon her. One day as I was watching her with a look of
pity, ‘Oh! I am overpaid,’ she said, ‘by that kind look.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“She often begged of me to remain in the room, because
my presence calmed her. Sometimes, however, she would
ask me to go and attend to my business; and when I
answered that I had nothing else to do than to take care
of her, ‘How good you are,’ she would exclaim with her
feeble though <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>pénétrante</em></span> voice; ‘you are too kind; you
spoil me; I do not deserve all that; I am too happy!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her delirium was intense. It bore principally on the
reign of Athalie, on the family of Jacob, in which she
liked to persuade herself that I was tenderly beloved, on
the contentions of Israel and Judah. ‘Would it not be
strange,’ she said, ‘if, being your wife, I were obliged to
sacrifice myself for a king?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was in fear of troubles, of proscriptions, and prepared
herself to meet them with the fortitude which characterized
her in real dangers. She thought there was to
be a persecution against Christians, and reckoned upon
me to protect the oppressed. ‘It appears to me,’ she said,
‘that the world is beginning over again; nothing but
fresh experiments. Why are not all things going on
according to your wishes?’ All these thoughts were
confused in her head; she believed we were in Egypt
and Syria.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We thought once her ravings had ceased. ‘Am I
not mad?’ she exclaimed. ‘Come nearer; tell me if I
have lost my reason.’ I answered that I should be very
sorry to take for absurdities all the kind things she had
said to me. ‘Have I said anything kind? But I have
also said many silly things; have we not acted the tragedy
of Athalie? What! I am married to the sincerest of
men, and I cannot know the truth. It is still your kindness;
you want to spare my head. Do speak; I am
resigned to the disgrace of being mad.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We succeeded at length in calming her. I told her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>she was valued and loved. ‘Ah!’ she answered, ‘I do
not care to be valued, so long as I am loved.’ Another
time she said: ‘Fancy what a state my poor head is in;
what an odd thing it is that I cannot remember whether
Virginie and M. de Lasteyrie are betrothed or united.
Help me to collect my thoughts.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes we could hear her praying in her bed. She
made her daughters read prayers to her. There was
something heavenly in the manner she twice repeated
Tobit’s prayers applicable to her state, the same she had
recited to her daughters on seeing the steeples of Olmütz
for the first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I approached her. ‘It is from the book of Tobit,’ she
said: ‘I sing badly; that is why I recite it.’ Another
time she composed a most beautiful prayer which lasted
full an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One day I was speaking to her of her angelic gentleness.
‘Yes,’ she said; ‘God has made me gentle; though
my gentleness is not like yours; I have not such high
pretensions. You are so strong as well as so gentle, and
you are very good to me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is you who are good,’ I answered, ‘and generous
above all. Do you remember my first departure for
America? Everybody against me, and you hiding your
tears at M. de Ségur’s marriage. You tried not to appear
in grief, for fear of bringing down more blame upon me.’
‘True,’ she said, ‘it was rather nice for a child. But how
kind of you to remember so far back!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“She spoke very sensibly of her daughters’ happiness,
of the good and noble character of her sons-in-law.
‘Nevertheless, I have not been able to make them as
happy as I am. It would have required all God’s power
to have brought about that again.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not to boast, my dear friend, that I tell you all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>this, although one might well be proud of it, but I find
comfort in repeating to you and to myself how tender
and how happy she was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How happy she would have been this winter—all her
children near her, the war finished for George and Louis,
the birth of Virginie’s child, and, I may add, after an
illness which, owing to our past fears, would have made
her doubly dear to us. Had she not to the last, the kindness
of thinking of my amusements at La Grange, of my
farm, of all that was of daily interest to me! When I
spoke to her of returning home: ‘Ah!’ she said, ‘that
would be too delicious. My God, my God!’ she exclaimed,
‘six more poor years of La Grange!’ She wanted to return
there with me, and begged of me to start before her. I
entreated her to allow me to stay, and asked her to rest
a little. She promised to do her best; and as she became
calmer, ‘Well,’ she said, ‘remain, wait a little; I shall
go quietly to sleep.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The disordered state of her brain did not prevent her
having misgivings as to her approaching end. The night
which preceded the last I heard her saying to her nurse,
‘Do not leave me; tell me when I am to die.’ At my
approach her fears subsided; but when I spoke to her
of recovery, of returning to La Grange: ‘Oh no! I am
going to die. Have you any cause of complaint against
me?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘For what, my dear? you have always been so good
and so loving!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Have I, then, been a gentle companion to you?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yes; assuredly.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Well, then, give me your blessing.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“On all these last evenings, when she thought I was
going to leave her, she would ask for my blessing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I spoke to her of the happiness of our union; of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>tenderness. She took pleasure in hearing me repeat the
assurance of my love. ‘Promise me,’ she said, ‘to preserve
that affection forever. Promise me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may well believe that I promised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Are you satisfied with your children?’ she added.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told her how completely they satisfied me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘They are very good,’ she said; ‘support them with
all your love for me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then delirium coming on again, ‘How do you think
they feel with respect to the house of Jacob?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I assured her that they entered into all her feelings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Ah!’ she replied, ‘my feelings are very moderate,
except those I have for you.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twice only her excitement became intense. It was
then the wanderings of maternal love. One day George,
to prevent her speaking too much, had for several hours
kept away from her room. When he came in again, she
evidently thought he had just returned from the army.
The wildness of her joy on seeing him made her heart
beat in a fearful manner. Another time she fell into an
ecstasy of joy at the thought of an anniversary dear to
our hearts—of the day when, twenty-eight years before,
she had given me George. That anniversary was the
day of her death.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One cannot admire sufficiently the meekness, the patience,
the unchanging kindness of that angelic woman
during this long and cruel malady. In her delirium,
which lasted a whole month, she was always thinking of
us and fearing to weary her friends. ‘I am very troublesome,’
she would often say; ‘my children,’ she one day
added, ‘must make up their mind to have a silly mother
since you are willing to have such a silly wife.’ But
never the slightest sign of impatience nor of ill humor.
Even when it was most repugnant to her to drink anything,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>a word from me or from her children, or, in our absence,
the idea that the nurse might be blamed, sufficed
to decide her; and up to the last, each service was acknowledged
by a kind word, a motion of the head or
of the hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Never,’ the doctor said, ‘have I seen in the course
of a long practice anything to be compared to that adorable
disposition and to delirium so extraordinary. No,
never have I seen anything which could give me the
idea that human perfection could go so far.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“A few moments before she breathed her last she
murmured to us that she was not suffering. ‘No doubt
she does not suffer,’ exclaimed the nurse; ‘she is an
angel.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was very remarkable to what a degree her wanderings
corresponded with the different shades of her affection.
When I was concerned, her judgment was always
sound. Though placing us all in the most fantastic situations,
her mind was never at fault with respect to my
principles and feelings. She would exclaim, ‘Decide;
you are leader; it is our happy lot to obey you.’ One
day I was attempting to calm her; she gayly repeated
this verse:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘A vos sages conseils, Seigneur, je m’abandonne.’</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“With respect to our children,—I speak of all six,—whom
she always recognized and welcomed, whom she
always spoke to in the kindest and most loving manner,
and whose various characters and dispositions ever remained
clearly present to her mind, there was still something
less lucid in her thoughts than with regard to me.
As for her grandchildren, she spoke of them several
times to me with charming details; but more frequently
her ideas were confused with respect to their number,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>their sex, and even to the existence of the two last. She
was most affectionate throughout to her sister, Madame
de Montagu; she frequently inquired from us both how
my mother was, fancying we had seen her lately. We
shuddered on hearing her calmly say on the morning of
her death, ‘To-day I shall see my mother.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last day she told me, ‘When you see Madame
de Simiane, give her my love.’ Thus her heart was all
life when her poor limbs were already numbed by approaching
death.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have already told you without any particulars that
she had received the sacraments. I was present during
the ceremony, which was more painful to us than to herself,
for she had already taken the sacrament in her bed
a short time previously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next day, before she became quite speechless,
Madame de Montagu and my daughters, fearing that my
presence might prevent her from praying at her ease,
asked me to leave them. My first impulse was to refuse
their request, however tenderly and timidly made; I had
a passionate desire to occupy her thoughts exclusively.
However, I repressed my feelings, and gave up my place
to her sister. I was scarcely gone when she called me
back. So soon as I got nearer, she again took my hand
in hers, saying, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je suis toute à vous</em></span>.’ These were her
last words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It has been said that she had often lectured me.
That was not her way; she frequently expressed, in the
course of her delirium, the idea that she would go to
heaven. She told me several times, ‘This life is short and
full of troubles; let us unite in God and depart together
for eternity.’ She wished us all, and me in particular,
the peace of the Lord. Such is the manner in which
that dear angel expressed herself during her illness, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>well as in the will she had made a few years ago, and
which is a model of refinement, of elevation of mind,
and of eloquence from the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems as if, by dwelling on these details, I was
trying to defer that last period, when, on seeing the
doctor giving up all hopes of her recovery, and only
thinking of prolonging life, we felt that for her there
was to be no to-morrow. Until then we had only appeared
before her two or three at a time; but that day,
as she seemed to be seeking for us, we saw no harm in
admitting all the members of the family, who seated
themselves in a semi-circle before her, so that she could
see every one. ‘What a pleasant sight!’ she said, while
looking on us with complacency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She called for her daughters in turn, and had a
charming word for each of them. She gave them each
her blessing. I feel confident that she was happy during
that morning. And how could the last moments be
otherwise than calm for her whose piety, far from being troubled
by terrors and scruples, never ceased to be all
the time of her illness, before and during her delirium,
all love and gratitude for the blessings, to use her own
words, which God had bestowed and was still bestowing
on her? for her who, notwithstanding the state of her
brain, never lost a single joy which a heart such as hers
could feel? Her delirium even became less confused.
Instead of asking Madame de Montagu how my mother
was, she told her, ‘I look upon you as having succeeded
to her.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt she felt that the last moment was approaching,
when, after having told me in so touching a manner:
‘Have you been happy with me? Are you kind enough
to love me? Well, then, give me your blessing.’ and
when I answered: ‘You love me also, you will give me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>your <a id='corr284.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='blessing”'>blessing’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_284.1'><ins class='correction' title='blessing”'>blessing’</ins></a></span>; she gave me hers for the first and last time
in a solemn and loving manner. Then her six children,
each in turn, kissed her hand and face. She looked at
them with inexpressible tenderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still more surely had she the idea of her approaching
end, when, fearing a convulsion, as I believe, she made me
a sign to step back; and, as I remained near her, she laid
my hand on her eyes with a look of tender gratitude,
thus giving me to understand what was the last duty she
expected from me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We felt during these hours of gentle agony a struggle
between the want of expressing our love, which she enjoyed
so much, and the belief that these emotions wore
out the little that was left in her of life. I kept in my
words with nearly as much care as I repressed my sobs,
when the touching expression of her eyes, a few scarcely
uttered words, tore from my lips the expression of the
feelings with which my heart was bursting. She revived,
and found strength to exclaim: ‘Is it then true
you have loved me? How happy I am! Kiss me.’ She
raised her poor arms, which were almost lifeless, with
wonderful animation. She passed one round my neck,
and drawing my head towards hers, she pressed me to
her heart, repeating: ‘What a blessing! how happy I
am to be yours!’ Until her right hand became motionless,
she carried mine successively to her lips and to her
heart. My left hand did not leave hers, and as long as
she breathed, I could feel that pressure, which seemed
still to mean, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Je suis toute à vous</em></span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“We all surrounded her bed, which had been drawn
into the middle of the room. She motioned to her sister
to sit down by her. Her three daughters were continually
applying hot towels to her hands and arms to
preserve the last remnant of warmth. We knelt down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>following the slow motion of her breath. There was no
appearance of pain, the benevolent smile was playing
upon her lips, my hand was still within hers; and thus
this angel of goodness and love breathed her last. We
bathed with tears the lifeless remains of that adorable
being. I felt myself dragged away by M. de Mun and
M. de Tracy, and so bade my last farewell to her, and
to all happiness on earth....</p>

<p class='c010'>“On Monday that angelic woman was borne to the
spot near which repose her grandmother, her mother,
and her sister, amongst sixteen hundred other victims....</p>

<p class='c010'>“We found in her writing-book a letter to me written
in 1785, several injunctions made in 1792, and an official
will of 1804. This memorandum, which was only a
rough copy, was nevertheless a masterpiece of tenderness,
of refinement, and of heart-felt eloquence. It
speaks of religion with simple and touching sublimity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I love, my dear friend, to confide to your bosom all
these recollections of the past; for what else now remains,
save recollections, of that adorable woman to
whom I have owed during thirty-four years an ever-enduring
and unclouded happiness? She was attached
to me, I may say, by the most ardent feelings; yet never
did I perceive in her the slightest shade of selfishness,
of displeasure, or of jealousy. If I look back to the
days of our youth, how many unexampled proofs of delicacy
and generosity come across my mind! She was
associated heart and soul with all my political wishes
and opinions, and Madame de Tessé might well say that
her devotion was a mixture of the catechism and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>declaration des droits</em></span>. I must again refer to an expression
of her aunt’s, who said to me yesterday, ‘I never
could have believed that it was possible to be so fanatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of your opinions, and at the same time so devoid of party
spirit.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know as well as I do all she was, and all she did
during the Revolution. It is not for having come to
Olmütz, as Charles Fox so elegantly expressed it, on
the wings of duty and of love, that I mean to praise
her now; it is for having remained in France until she
had secured, so far as lay in her power, the material
comforts of my aunt and the rights of my creditors; it
is for having had the courage to send George to America.
What noble imprudence to remain, the only woman in
France endangered by the name she bore, but who always
refused to change it!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Each of her petitions and declarations began by these
words: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La femme La Fayette</em></span>. Indulgent as she was
with respect to calumny and party hatred, never did she
allow, even at the foot of the scaffold, a reflection upon
me to pass without protesting against it. She had prepared
herself to speak in that spirit before the tribunal,
and we have all seen how good, simple, and easy in common
life was that lofty-minded and courageous woman.
Her piety was also of a peculiar nature. I may say
that during thirty-four years I never once experienced
from it the slightest shadow of inconvenience. No affectation
in her religious practices, which were always subordinate
to my convenience. I have had the satisfaction
of seeing the least pious of my friends as well received, as
much esteemed, and their virtues as fully acknowledged
by her as if there had been no difference of religious
opinions between her and them. Never did she express
to me anything but hope, even conviction, that upon
mature reflection, with the uprightness of heart she
knew I possessed, I should end by being convinced.
The recommendations which she has left me are in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>same spirit, entreating me to read, for the love of her,
several books which I shall examine again with the most
solemn attention. She used to call religion sovereign
liberty, to make me appreciate it more, and often repeated
with pleasure these words of Abbé Fauchet:
‘Jesus Christ, my only master’ (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Jésus Christ, mon seul
maître</em></span>).</p>

<p class='c010'>“This letter would never come to an end, my dear
friend, if I gave way to the feelings which inspire it. I

<p class='c009'>THE account of the death of Madame La Fayette,
which occurred in 1807, has taken us a few years
beyond the time we had reached in the history of
La Fayette’s political career, and we return to the
period of his return to France after his long imprisonment.
Shortly after this, La Fayette received
the painful intelligence of the death of General Washington.
He had fondly cherished the hope of again
visiting his adored friend at Mt. Vernon, and perhaps
taking his wife and family to behold his illustrious
American general. The marquis immediately
wrote a letter of condolence and sympathy to the
family of Washington, and received from them a pair
of pistols which General Washington had left to La
Fayette in his will.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1800 La Fayette and Maubourg were presented to
the First Consul at the Tuileries. Napoleon received
them with great politeness, and amidst their expressions
of personal gratitude to Bonaparte, they added many
compliments regarding his Italian campaign. Napoleon
sometimes discussed with La Fayette American matters
and affairs in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon, speaking to La Fayette of his campaigns in
America, once remarked, “The highest interests of the
whole world were there decided by the skirmishes of
patrols.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One day Bonaparte said to him, “You must have
found the French much <em>cooled</em> on the subject of liberty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied La Fayette; “but they are in a state to
receive it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“They are disgusted,” answered the First Consul.
“Your Parisians—for instance, the shop-keepers—oh,
they want no more of it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not use the expression lightly, General,” said
La Fayette; “I am not ignorant of the effect of the
follies and crimes which have defiled the name of liberty;
but the French are perhaps more than ever in a
state to receive it. It is for you to give it; from you
they await it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon proffered to La Fayette the office of senator,
but it was declined. The post of ambassador to the
United States was then offered him, but as he felt himself
almost a citizen of America, he was not willing to
go there in such capacity as should force him to watch
her with a jealous eye in order to uphold the rights of
his own country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning this offer La Fayette wrote to Masclet:
“I shall not go to America, my dear Masclet, at least
not in a diplomatic capacity. I am far from abandoning
the idea of making private and patriotic visits to the
United States, and to my fellow-citizens of the New
World, but at present I am much more intent upon
farming than upon embassies. It seems to me that were
I to arrive in America in any other costume than an
American uniform, I should be as embarrassed with my
appearance as a savage in breeches.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1802 La Fayette met at a dinner party Lord Cornwallis,
the newly appointed British minister to France.
During their conversation Cornwallis asked La Fayette’s
opinion regarding Napoleon’s administration, as to
whether it was consistent with his ideas of liberty. La
Fayette boldly replied that it was not. Spies were not
long in carrying this daring answer to Bonaparte.
Napoleon was displeased; and when next he met La
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Fayette, he said, “Lord Cornwallis claims that you
are not yet corrected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what?” asked La Fayette—“of my love of
liberty? What should disgust me with that? The
extravagances and crimes of terrorist tyranny have only
served to make me hate more heartily every arbitrary
régime, and attach myself more strongly to my principles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you have spoken to him of our affairs,” said
the Consul, with evident displeasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one is further than myself,” replied La Fayette,
“from seeking a foreign ambassador to censure what is
passing in my own country; but if he ask me if this is
liberty, I must answer No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must say to you, General La Fayette,” said Bonaparte,—“and
I perceive it with pain,—that, by your
manner of speaking of the acts of the government, you
give its enemies the weight of your name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What more can I do?” was the fearless reply. “I
live in the country in retirement; I avoid, as far as
I can, occasions of speaking of public affairs; but when
any one demands of me if your administration of the
government is conformable to my ideas of liberty, I
shall say that it is not. I wish to be prudent, but I
cannot be false.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But are you not convinced,” replied he, “that in the
state in which I found France I was forced to irregular
measures?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is not the question,” he answered. “I speak
neither of the time, nor of this or that act; it is the
tendency—yes, General, it is the tendency of affairs—which
pains me and disturbs me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As to the rest,” Napoleon then replied, “I have
spoken to you as the chief of the government; and in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>capacity I complain of you. But as a private individual
I ought to be content, because, in all which has been told
me concerning you, I have perceived that in spite of
your severity upon the acts of government, there has
always been on your part personal good will for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right,” he answered. “A free government
with you at its head—I should have nothing more to
desire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One day La Fayette dined at the house of Madame
de Staël, with Joseph Bonaparte and some members of
that ephemeral opposition, whom Napoleon had not
expelled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are dissatisfied,” Joseph said to him, in the
midst of the conversation. “You are not with us; but
permit me to say to you that you are no more with these
gentlemen. They desire a rotation of directors who differ
in their striking of the shoulder. To-day it is one
man; to-morrow it will be another; in place of that,
if we have a régime conformed to your principles, you
would be pleased that my brother should remain chief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When La Fayette was asked to vote for the decree
declaring Napoleon First Consul for life, he replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot vote for such a magistracy until public
liberty has been sufficiently guaranteed. Then I will
give my vote to Napoleon Bonaparte.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>JOSEPH BONAPARTE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette addressed to the First Consul the following
letter at this time:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Grange</span>, May 20, 1802.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>General</span>: When a man filled with the gratitude
which he owes you, and too much alive to glory not
to admire yours, has placed restrictions on his suffrage,
those restrictions will be so much the less suspected
when it is known that none more than himself would
delight to see you chief magistrate for life of a free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>republic. The 18th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Brumaire</em></span> saved France, and I felt
that I was recalled by the liberal professions to which
you have attached your honor. We afterwards beheld
in the consular power that restorative dictatorship,
which, under the auspices of your genius, has achieved
such great things—less great, however, than will be
the restoration to liberty. It is impossible that you,
General, the first in that order of men (whom, to quote
and compare, would require me to retrace every page of
history) can wish that such a revolution, so many victories,
so much blood and miseries, should produce to
the world and to ourselves no other results than an
arbitrary system. The French people know their rights
too well to have entirely forgotten them. But perhaps
they are better able to recover them now with advantage
than in the heat of effervescence; and you, by the
power of your character and the public confidence;
by the superiority of your talents, your situation, and
your fortune, may, by re-establishing liberty, subdue
our dangers and calm our inquietudes. I have no other
than patriotic and personal motives in wishing for you,
as the climax of our glory, a permanent magistrative
post; but it is in unity with my principles, my engagements,
the actions of my whole life, to ascertain, before
I vote, that liberty is established on a basis worthy of
the nation and of you. I hope you will now acknowledge,
General, as you have already had occasion to do,
that to firmness in my political opinions are joined my
sincere sentiments of my obligations to you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This memorable letter was never answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette, in his “Mémoires,” thus comments upon
his opposition to Napoleon: “It appears that Bonaparte
had for a long time preserved his good-will towards me;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>and even after my letter, when one had declared before
him, that there had not been any opposition to the
Consulate for life, except from the Jacobin votes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No,’ said he, ‘there were the enthusiasts for liberty:
La Fayette, for example.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. de Vaines, a member of the Cabinet Council, to
whom he addressed his remark, observed that without
doubt, I had believed it to be my duty to vote according
to my principles, because no one could doubt of
my personal attachment to Bonaparte.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Really,’ replied he, ‘he ought to be content with the
government.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The blame of this rupture has often been laid entirely
to my charge; but his resolution and his character
left me no hope of being useful. As he advanced
farther in his fatal course, the rupture was more inevitable.
If any one has the desire of tracing for himself the
good will of my feelings towards Bonaparte, he has only
to search through my correspondence with my friends.
It suffices that these letters, written at different times,
free me from all reproach of ambition or caprice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The foreigners who most desired to see me in office,
were not tardy in feeling that I was right. But I will
never despair of liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The character of General La Fayette,’ said Klopstock,
a little while after my release from Olmütz, ‘prevents
him from well knowing his nation; how could he
believe them capable of possessing free institutions?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“His judgment was an error, which the excesses of
the Jacobins had but too far scattered. Later, one of
his friends, who was also mine, wrote to me thus: ‘Klopstock
died with his old attachment for you. We had
together a long conversation regarding you, when I
made to him my last, visit; he approved of you, and besought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>me that I should write to you, and salute you
most cordially for him. I present to you this last homage,
coming, so to speak, from the other world.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was also touched, without doubt, to read in a letter
written from Rome (by Madame de Staël): ‘I shall hope
always for the human race as long as you exist. I address
you this sentiment from the sublime Capitol, and
the benedictions of its shades come to you through my
voice.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“To multiply such citations, and to repeat the most
flattering opinions from Europe and America, I should
have the appearance of giving way to a vanity from which
it is easy to defend one’s self after one has acted amidst
great circumstances; and particularly, after one has been
the butt of some enthusiasm, one feels that there is
nothing but a true esteem which is worthy of regard. I
have myself said elsewhere, ‘There is, then, some good
in my retirement, since it publishes and maintains the
idea that liberty is not abandoned without exception and
without hope.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette thus describes his meeting with Charles
Fox:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Peace d’Amiens brought over a great number
of Englishmen. ‘They are all malecontents,’ observed
the ambassador Livingston; ‘some have expected to find
France wild; they have found her flourishing: the
others hoped to see here traces of liberty; all are disappointed.’
I was at Chavaniac when Charles Fox and
General Fitzpatrick arrived in Paris. They wished to
send for me, as I was one of the principal objects of
their visit. I hastened to join them. M. and Madame
Fox, Fitzpatrick, MM. John and Trotter, passed several
days at La Grange. I met at Paris the Lords Holland
and Lauderdale, the new Duke of Bedford, M. Adair, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>M. Erskine, whom I pressed in vain to write regarding
the jury of England and of France. ‘The first years of
the Revolution,’ said they, ‘we had great hopes; but the
excesses have ruined the good cause.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“One day Fox, with his amiable goodness of heart,
said to me in the presence of my son, that I should not be
too much affected by an unavoidable delay. ‘Liberty will
return,’ said he, ‘but not for us; for George, perhaps,
and surely for his children.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time La Fayette met with a severe injury,
caused by a fall upon the ice. His hip-bone was broken,
and the accident was followed by a long and painful illness.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1803 President Jefferson offered to appoint La
Fayette governor of the newly acquired territory of Louisiana.
The land allotted to La Fayette as a former
major-general in the American army was selected from
the fertile fields of that territory. But notwithstanding
La Fayette’s love for America, he felt constrained to
remain in France, and therefore declined the kindly
proffered honor.</p>

<p class='c010'>After Napoleon had been crowned emperor, he is
reported to have said to his Council, one day: “Gentlemen,
I know your devotion to the power of the throne.
Every one in France is corrected; I was thinking of the
only man who is not,—La Fayette. He has never retreated
from his line. You see him quiet; but I tell
you he is quite ready to begin again.”</p>

<div id='i372'  class='figcenter id024'>
<img src='images/i-372.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>CHARLES FOX.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>During the brief reign of Louis XVIII. and the banishment
of Napoleon to Elba, La Fayette appeared only
once at court. When the sudden return of Bonaparte
startled the world, and the trembling King Louis saw
his power depart, one of the king’s minister’s exclaimed:
“All is lost! There is no endurance, no indignity, to
which the king would not submit, to retain his throne.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“What!” said another; “even La Fayette?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied the first; “even La Fayette himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Napoleon again resumed the reins of power and
re-established an hereditary peerage, La Fayette was
pressed to take his seat by Joseph Bonaparte, who had
been sent to the marquis by Napoleon; but La Fayette’s
reply to the offered honor was consistent with all his
former actions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Should I ever again appear on the scene of public
life, <em>it can only be as the representative of the people</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding the efforts of Joseph Bonaparte in his behalf,
La Fayette says: “I was preparing to return to
Chavaniac in September, 1804, when my relative and
friend, Ségur, Grand Master of Ceremonies, wrote to me
that Joseph Bonaparte had charged him with a message
for me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The Prince Joseph,’ said he to me, at Paris, some
time afterwards, ‘wishes to attribute your retirement to
a sentiment of the philosopher; but he observes with
pain and disquietude that his brother regards it as a
state of hostility. The friendship of Prince Joseph for
you, presses you to place a limit to this situation. He
regretted that you have not wished to be a senator. He
asked only your name. You would not have to leave
La Grange. His idea to-day is still less exceptional.
There is a question of your being one of the dignitaries
of the Legion of Honor; in short, said he, your military
record in America and Europe is such as gives this
thing but the consequence adapted to your retirement,
which in refusing will have a hostile effect. But before
going farther, he wished to be assured that you will not
refuse it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I began to reply, but Ségur besought me to reflect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and the following is what I repeated the next
day: ‘I am greatly touched by the good will of Prince
Joseph; but he will permit me to observe to him that in
my singular position, the Grand Cordon, although I am
well pleased that he should offer it, would seem to me
to be ridiculous, admitting even that it were the accompaniment
of an office. But it follows that I am to be
nothing, and in being that, it follows so much the more,
as this is nothing more than the chivalry of an order of
things contrary to my principles; I cannot therefore
accept it. The qualification given to my retirement is
strange when one compares the imperial power to my
little influence; but if it is indispensable that I should
be something, I should be less repugnant to the Senate;
where, however, my opinions would oblige me to incur,
on the other hand, a more just title of reproach than the
emperor gives to me. I demand, then, that the friendship
of his brother should remove from me all these conditions.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“My response was well carried. ‘For the present,’
said Prince Joseph, ‘when I know the intentions of M.
de La Fayette, I will profit by the occasions to serve
him, but in accordance with his opinions.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus declined the peerage, La Fayette being
warmly urged by the inhabitants of his district, accepted
the appointment as their representative to the elective
body, instituted to sit in connection with the Peers. As
a member of the Chamber of Deputies, he continued to
maintain and uphold his liberal principles with fearless
eloquence whenever occasion demanded it. After the
overthrow at Waterloo, La Fayette stipulated in the
Assembly that the liberty and life of Napoleon should
be guaranteed by the nation, and endeavored to obtain
for him two frigates to conduct Bonaparte safely to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>United States; but it was too late. La Fayette was sent
by the Assembly to meet the victorious generals, and
prevent, if possible, their coming to Paris, by proposing
terms of capitulation. Lord Stewart said to La Fayette:
“I must inform you, sir, that there can be no peace with
the allied powers, unless you deliver up Bonaparte to
us.” “I am surprised,” replied La Fayette, with calm
dignity and suppressed scorn, “that to propose so base
an act to the French nation, you address yourself by
choice to a prisoner of Olmütz.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Louis XVIII. was again forced upon the French people
by the allies, contrary to the wishes of both the nation
and La Fayette; and the marquis accordingly once again
retired to La Grange. Here he received his many friends
and visitors with the most stately and yet warm-hearted
cordiality, blending the courtesy of the gentleman of
noble family with the sincerity and frankness of the
man of the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>An English lady who enjoyed the pleasure of being a
guest at La Grange in 1818 thus pictures the life there:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Charming days, more charming evenings, flow on in
a perpetual stream of enjoyment here. In the mornings
Madame George La Fayette, the Countess Lasteyrie, and
the Countess Maubourg are busy with the children, and
do not appear. The visitors amuse themselves or are
with the general, unless his occupations prevent. Then
comes a walk or drive—sometimes a long excursion.
After dinner at four o’clock, conversation; in the evening,
music or talking. Before breakfast I find all the
young people at their easels, painting from models in the
anteroom; then they go to their music (there are three
pianos, and a music-master and an English governess live
in the house); then they all turn out into the beautiful
park for two hours, and then resume their studies for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>two hours more. But I never saw such happy children;
they live without restraint, and except while at their
lessons, are always with the grown people. If the little
ones are noisy, they are sent into the anteroom; but
their gentleness and good conduct are astonishing, considering,
too, that eleven of the twelve are always with us.”
All of La Fayette’s children continued to make their
home with him until the time of his death; and his
grandchildren were a constant source of delight to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another delightful description of the home life at La
Grange is given by Lady Morgan, who visited France
about this time. She says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“General La Fayette has not appeared in Paris since
the return of the Bourbon dynasty to France. And I
should have left that country without having seen one
of its greatest ornaments, had not a flattering invitation
from the Château La Grange enabled me to gratify a
wish, long and devoutly cherished, of knowing, or at
least of beholding, its illustrious master. Introduced by
proxy to the family of La Fayette, by the young and
amiable Princess Charlotte de B——, we undertook our
journey to La Grange with the same pleasure as the pilgrim
takes his first unwearied steps to the shrine of
sainted excellence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the midst of a fertile and luxuriant wilderness,
rising above prolific orchards and antiquated woods, appeared
the five towers of La Grange, tinged with the
golden rays of the setting sun. Through the branches
of the trees appeared the pretty village of Aubepierre,
once, perhaps, the dependency of the castle, and clustering
near the protection of its walls. A remoter view of
the village of D’Hieres, with its gleaming river and
romantic valley, was caught and lost alternately in the
serpentine mazes of the rugged road; which, accommodated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>to the grouping of the trees, wound amidst
branches laden with ripening fruit, till its rudeness suddenly
subsided in the velvet lawn that immediately surrounded
the castle. The deep moat, the drawbridge,
the ivied tower and arched portals, opening into the
square court, had a feudal and picturesque character;
and combined with the reserved tints and fine repose of
evening, associated with that exaltation of feeling which
belonged to the moment, preceding a first interview with
those on whom the mind has long dwelt with admiration
or interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We found General La Fayette surrounded by his
patriarchal family—his excellent son and daughter-in-law,
his two daughters (the sharers of his dungeon in
Olmütz) and their husbands, eleven grandchildren, and a
venerable granduncle, the ex-grand prior of Malta, with
hair as white as snow, and his cross and his order worn
as proudly as when he had issued forth at the head of
his pious troops against the ‘paynim foe,’ or Christian
enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such was the group that received us in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>salon</em></span> of
La Grange; such was the close-knit circle that made our
breakfast and our dinner party, accompanied us in our
delightful rambles through the grounds and woods of La
Grange, and constantly presented the most perfect unity
of family interests, habits, tastes, and affections.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We naturally expect to find strong traces of time in
the form of those with whose names and deeds we have
been long acquainted, of those who had obtained the suffrages
of the world, almost before we had entered it.
But, on the person of La Fayette, time has left no impression;
not a wrinkle furrows the ample brow; and his
unbent and noble figure is still as upright, bold, and
vigorous as the mind that informs it. Grace, strength,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and dignity still distinguish the fine person of this
extraordinary man; who, though more than forty years
before the world, engaged in scenes of strange and eventful
conflict, does not yet appear to have reached his
climacteric.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bustling and active in his farm, graceful and elegant
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>salon</em></span>, it is difficult to trace, in one of the most
successful agriculturists, and one of the most perfectly
fine gentlemen that France has produced, a warrior and
a legislator. The patriot, however, is always discernible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the full possession of every faculty and talent he
ever possessed, the memory of M. La Fayette has all the
tenacity of unworn youthful recollections; and, besides
these, high views of all that is most elevated in the
mind’s conception. His conversation is brilliantly enriched
with anecdotes of all that is celebrated, in character
and event, for the last fifty years. He still talks
with unwearied delight of his short visit to England, to
his friend Mr. Fox, and dwelt on the witchery of the
late Duchess of Devonshire with almost boyish enthusiasm.
He speaks and writes English with the same
elegance he does his native tongue. He has made himself
master of all that is best worth knowing in English
literature and philosophy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I observed that his library contained many of our
most eminent authors upon all subjects. His elegant
and well-chosen collection of books occupies the highest
apartments in one of the towers of the château; and,
like the study of Montaigne, hangs over the farm-yard
of the philosophical agriculturist. ‘It frequently happens,’
said M. La Fayette, as we were looking out of the
window at some flocks which were moving beneath, ‘it
frequently happens that my merinos and my hay carts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>dispute my attention with your Hume or our own Voltaire.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“He spoke with great pleasure of the visit paid him
at La Grange some years ago by Mr. Fox and General
Fitzpatrick. He took me out, the morning after my
arrival, to show me a tower richly covered with ivy. ‘It
was Mr. Fox,’ he said, ‘who planted that ivy! I have
taught my children to venerate it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Château La Grange does not, however, want
other points of interest.... Founded by Louis Le
Gros, and occupied by the Princes of Lorraine, the
mark of a cannon-ball is still visible in one of its towers,
which penetrated the masonry, when attacked by Maréchal
Turenne. Here in the plain, but spacious, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>salon-à-manger</em></span>,
the peasantry of the neighborhood and the
domestics of the castle assemble every Sunday evening
in winter to dance to the violin of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>concierge</em></span>, and are
regaled with cakes and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>eau sucrée</em></span>. The general is usually,
and his family are always, present at these rustic
balls. The young people occasionally dance among the
tenantry, and set the example of the new steps, freshly
imported by their Paris dancing-master.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the summer this patriarchal reunion takes place
in the park, where a space is cleared for the purpose,
shaded by the lofty trees which encircle it. A thousand
times, in contemplating La Fayette, in the midst of his
charming family, the last years of the life of the Chancellor
de l’Hopital recurred to me, ... he whom the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>naïve</em></span> Brantome likens to Cato! and who, loving liberty
as he hated faction, retired from a court unworthy of his
virtues, to his little domain of Vignay, which he cultivated
himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1819 La Fayette was again chosen a member of
the Chamber of Deputies. His many stirring and eloquent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>speeches in favor of liberty, and his fearless
denunciations of despotic tyranny, aroused the fear and
hatred of Louis XVIII. In 1823 the king ordered his
solicitor-general to accuse La Fayette of treason. The
charge was made publicly in the Chamber of Deputies,
and for a moment was received with profound silence.
Then La Fayette slowly rose from his seat, and with
calm and commanding dignity took his stand upon
the tribune. With folded arms he surveyed the assembly
with unquailing eye; and then he spoke: “In
spite of my habitual indifference to party accusations
and animosities, I still think myself bound to say a
single word upon this occasion. During the whole
course of a life entirely devoted to liberty, I have
constantly been an object of attack to the enemies of
that cause; under whatever form, despotic, aristocratic,
or anarchic, they have endeavored to combat it. I
do not complain, then, because I observe some affectation
in the use of the word ‘proved,’ which the solicitor-general
has employed against me; but I join my
honored friends in demanding a public inquiry, within
the walls of this chamber, and in the face of the
nation. Then, I and my adversaries, to whatever rank
they belong, may declare, without reserve, all that we
have mutually had to reproach each other with for the
last thirty years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His accusers recoiled from such a daring, and to them
condemnatory, challenge, and La Fayette was acquitted;
but the government, by intrigues and bribery, defeated
his re-election.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following speech of La Fayette, delivered in the
Chamber of Deputies in 1821, and published in the <cite>New
York American</cite>, of July, that same year, will give some
idea of the fearless eloquence of the marquis, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>dauntless frankness so incensed the corrupt court and
enraged the Bourbon king.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>New York American</cite> thus comments upon the
speech:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have allotted a considerable portion of our paper
to-day to a speech of General La Fayette, delivered last
month in the French Chamber of Deputies; and, in doing
so, we shall gratify, as we hope, that deep feeling of interest
with which every act of that ‘soldier of America,’
as he proudly calls himself, is looked upon by his fellow-citizens
of the United States. It will be seen that, true
to his early principles, this veteran friend of freedom
still maintains the doctrines to which this country owes
its existence and glory, and which, shackled and fettered
indeed, but still prevailing, he has the high honor of
having transplanted, sheltered, and under all changes
adhered to in France. It has, indeed, been truly and
beautifully said of La Fayette that he was among those
who took an active part in the French Revolution, perhaps
the only one ‘who had nothing to ask of oblivion.’
Pure and disinterested in his views and in his conduct,
the public good has ever been his object and his sole
aim; and the blessings of this great nation, in whose
favor he early drew his noble sword, and the respect of
every lover of liberty in every clime, bear testimony to
the consistency of a life which, midst every variety of
changes and perils, has never been sullied by meanness
nor dishonored by crime.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>General La Fayette’s Speech.</span></p>

<p class='c010'>During the discussions on the budget on the 4th of
June, which, in making appropriations for the expenditures
of the country, laid open to remark all the various
interests of France, M. La Fayette, having been called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>on to speak, presented himself at the tribune, and, after
the lively expressions of interest which his presence
there excited in the Chamber had subsided, spoke as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general discussion of the budget gives us the
right of making some summary remarks upon each of
its provisions. The public debt, however contracted, is
sacred. I regret, in common with others, its recent increase;
but without recriminations here, as the errors of
the first restoration, which produced the 20th March, or
as to the fatal landing which came to mingle itself with
the progress of a more salutary and less turbulent resistance,
or as to the conditions of the last treaty of
peace, stipulated exclusively between the powers at war
with France and the august ally of those powers, I will
confine myself to drawing from the past an important
lesson for the future, which is, that it would have cost,
as I said at the time, much less to expel the coalition of
foreigners than to treat with it; and that, if ever such a
state of things should recur, and that, following the example
of Napoleon and the provisional government, the
rulers of France should hesitate to call out the people <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en
masse</em></span>, it would be alike the duty and the safety of that
people themselves to leap to their arms, and combining
with one accord the million arms of her warlike generation
and devoted youth, to bury beneath them, as she
might do, the violators of her independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The civil list has been voted for the whole duration
of this reign; but when, in consequence of encroachments
and dilapidations forty million francs of personal
revenue for the monarch and his family begin to be considered
as insufficient, it is allowable to look at—I will
not say that country of ten millions of inhabitants, where
the salary of the chief magistrate is not equal to that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>a French minister, but at the monarchical, aristocratic,
and expensive government of England; where, nevertheless,
the provision for the princes is smaller than in
France; and where more than half the civil list is employed
in paying the diplomatic corps, ministers, and
judges; where the sum for which the king is not bound
to account does not exceed a million and a half of francs....
Whatever may have been the losses and the pressure
caused by a just defence against the aggressions of European
cabinets, and which the ambition of a conqueror
provoked, it must be owned, by more than one act of
perfidy on the part of those courts, has since immeasurably
increased; the enormous amount of the pension list
arises from other causes. These are to be found in the
rapid succession of the different governments in France,
each anxious to create vacancies in favor of its friends;
and, above all, in the recent irruption of a crowd of pretenders,
all claiming rewards for having, either in will or
in deed, in foreign pay or in domestic insurrections, on
the highways or in obscure idleness, and even beneath
the imperial liveries, manifested or dissembled their
opposition to those governments which, each flattered
in its turn, are now all called illegitimate. It is thus,
that by deviations and apostasies from a revolution of
liberty and equality, we have finished by seeing Europe
during some years inundated with two complete assortments
of dynasties,—nobility and privileged classes....</p>

<p class='c010'>“I come now, gentlemen, to the second part of our expenses,
the contingent part of the budget; but before remarking
upon its items separately, I would ask how we can
conscientiously support, by voting the ways and means,
a government so scandalously expensive, and of which
the system is hostile to the rights and to the wishes of
almost all those who contribute to its support; and who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>doubtless, only pay these contributions with a view to be
honestly served, and by those who will study the national
interest. It is to be hoped that this year the
special application of every sum to the object for which
it was voted will be closely scrutinized, as is the case in
other countries....</p>

<p class='c010'>“My unwillingness to vote for the expenses of foreign
affairs arises from the conviction that our diplomacy at
present is an absurdity. In truth, gentlemen, the system,
the agents, the language, all appear to me foreign
to regenerated France; she is again subjected to doctrines
that she had branded, to powers she had so often
conquered, to habits contracted among her enemies, to
obligations for which, on her own account at least, she
has no cause to blush. In the meanwhile, Europe,
aroused by us thirty years ago to liberty, checked indeed
since, as it must be confessed, by the view of our excesses
and the abuse of our victories, has resumed, and will
preserve, notwithstanding recent misfortunes, that great
march of civilization, at the head of which our French
place is marked, a place in which the eyes of all people
who are free, or aspiring to become so, should not seek
us in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, gentlemen, in this division of Europe between
two banners,—on the one side, despotism and aristocracy;
on the other, liberty and equality,—that liberty
and equality which we first proclaimed there,—where
do we find the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>soi-disant</em></span> organs of France? exempt, it is
true, and I am happy to acknowledge it, from a hostile
co-operation, in the aggression of the satellites of Troppau
and Laybach, whom a success of little duration, as
I hope, will only render more odious; they are also entitled
to our thanks for not having insulted France by
any positive participation in those recent declarations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the three powers, which, in order not to offend the majority
in this house, I will only characterize by repeating
my ardent wishes, the wishes of my life, for the emancipation
of the people, the independence of nations, and
the morality and dignity of the true social order. We
have, nevertheless, seen the agents of the French government,
in their subaltern participation in the first
deliberation of these congresses, not even to raise themselves
to the level, so easily attained, of liberality evinced
by the British diplomatists....</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such are not the doctrines of France. I speak not now
of my personal incredulity of the doctrine of the divine
right of kings; but I recall to you that already, long
before ’89, the era of the European revolution, when
we <span class='sc'>Soldiers of America</span> felt honored by the name
of <em>rebels</em> and insurgents then lavished upon us, all in
virtue of social order by the English government, Louis
XVI. and his ministers had expressly recognized the sovereignty
of the United States, founded as it was upon
the principles of their immortal declaration of independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These principles, since received into the bosom of the
constituent assembly, proclaimed in a degree, sworn to
by the king and his august brother amidst the greatest
of our patriotic solemnities, have been since acknowledged,
even in the usurpations of the imperial despotism,—they
were since repeated from this tribune as a
protecting truth by the friends of the charter and the
royal throne on the 19th of March, 1815, for then it was
not said that the charter was the counter-revolution;
and, indeed, in order to ascertain the share due to the
revolution of the rights recognized by the charter, that
share which has so often been denied, it would suffice to
read again an august proclamation, dated from Verona
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>in July, 1795. These principles, professed at this day
among that people who are our natural allies, outweigh
all the exploded pretensions which we have since renewed,
the moment that a noble effort of the nations
subjected by our arms had forced their old governments
in spite of themselves to recover the independence which
they had so completely, so servilely, so affectionately
alienated for the benefit of their conqueror; to whom, in
a recent note from Troppau, they have preserved the
noblest title he ever bore, in calling him the <em>soldier of
the Revolution</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In truth, gentlemen, the crimes and misfortunes
which we deplore are no more the Revolution than the
Saint Bartholomew was religion, or those you would call
monarchical, the eighteen thousand judicial murders of
the Duke of Alva....</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will only make one remark as to the public instruction.
The constitution of ’91 said, ‘There shall be organized
a system of public instruction open to all citizens,
gratuitous with respect to the indispensable parts of
education, and widely disseminated.’ Your committee,
on the contrary, exalting themselves to the height of the
emperor of Austria’s address to the professors at Laybach,
look upon gratuitous instruction as a <em>social disorder</em>,
and are particularly desirous to suppress the amount
destined for the encouragement of elementary instruction,
principally because it serves to favor the Lancasterian
system, which your committee does not think will
harmonize with the spirit of our institutions. Now, gentlemen,
the Lancasterian system is, since the invention
of printing, the greatest step which has been made for
the extension of prompt, easy, and popular instruction....</p>

<p class='c010'>“The expenses of the navy department are enormous.
The navy of the United States has already been cited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>you; that navy, whose flag, since its establishment and
during two spirited wars against the flag of Britain, has
never once failed with equal, and often with inferior,
force, to gain the advantage. The provisions, the pay,—everything
there, as has been observed to you,—are
higher than with us. Its cruisers amounted lately to
two ships of the line, nine frigates and fifteen smaller
vessels, protecting a commerce of more than 1,200,000
tons, without including the fisheries or the coasting
trade. The expenses of their navy department were
fixed last session at two and one-half millions of dollars,
and half a million more to build new vessels, making
sixteen millions of francs, calculated, indeed, for twelve
vessels of the line and twenty frigates, etc. But what a
difference between this sum and fifty millions of francs,
which are said to be insufficient for our navy!...</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not consider it as a departure from the question
under discussion as to the general administration of
the kingdom, if, by a rapid examination of the ancient
régime, I shall endeavor to furnish an answer to the
wishes and regrets of which it still seems the object. It
was from the destruction of this régime that we saw disappear
that corporation of clergy which, exercising all
sorts of influences and refusing all share in the common
burdens, increased continually and never alienated its
immense riches, but divided them among themselves;
which, rendering the law an accomplice in vows too
frequently forced, covering France with monastic orders
devoted to a foreign head, collected contributions both
in the garb of wealth and mendicity; and which, in its
secular organization, formed so considerable a portion of
the idle and unproductive class that the daily ministers
of the altar were the most insignificant portion of what
was called the first order of the state.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“We saw disappear that corporation of sovereign
courts where the privilege of judging was venal of
right, and, in fact, hereditary in the nobility; when
feudal judges, chosen and revocable by their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>seigneurs</em></span>,
presided; when the diversity of codes and the laws of
arrests made you lose before one tribunal the cause you
had gained before another.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We saw disappear that financial corporation oppressing
France beyond endurance, and by leases, whose monstrous
government exceeded in expense and profit the
receipts of the royal treasury, whose immense code, now
here recorded, formed an occult science which its agents
alone had the right or the means of interpreting, and
which, in rewarding perjury and informers, exercised
over all unprotected men a boundless and remorseless
tyranny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We saw disappear those distinctions of provinces,
<em>French</em>, <em>conquered</em>, <em>foreign</em>, etc., each surrounded with a
double row of custom-house officers and smugglers, from
whose intestine war the prisons, the galleys, and the
gibbet were recruited at the will of the stipendiaries of
him who <em>farmed the revenue</em>, and those other distinctions
of noble or common property; when the parks and gardens
of the rich paid nothing, while the land and the
person of the poor man were taxed in proportion to his
industry; when the tax upon the peasant and upon his
freehold recalled to nineteen-twentieths of the citizens
that their degradation was not only territorial, but individual
and personal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By its destruction, that constitutional equality was
consecrated which makes the general good the only foundation
of distinctions acknowledged by law. The privileged
class lost the right of distributing among themselves
exclusive privileges, and of treating with contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>all other classes of their fellow-citizens. No Frenchman
was now excluded from office because he might not come
of noble blood; or degraded, if noble, by the exercise of
a useful profession....</p>

<p class='c010'>“What more is there to regret? Is it the scheme of
taxation, regulated by the king at the will of a minister
of finance, whom I myself have seen changed twelve
times in fourteen years, and which taxation was distributed
arbitrarily among the provinces, and even among
the contributors?...</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it the capitation tax, established in 1702, to achieve
the peace, and never afterwards repealed? The two-twentieths
diminished on the contributions of the powerful
and made heavier on those of the poor; the land tax,
of which the basis was in Auvergne, nine sous out of
twenty, and amounting sometimes to fourteen, on <em>account
of the vast increase of privileged persons created by traffic
in places</em>? Finally, is it the odious duties on consumption,
more odious than the<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em> droits réunis</em></span> of Napoleon?
Is it the criminal jurisprudence, when the accused could
neither see his family, his friends, his country, nor the
documents by which he was to be tried?... When the
verdict, obscurely obtained, might be aggravated at the
pleasure of the judges by torture? for the torture preparatory
to the examination had been alone abolished....”</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>New York American</cite>, of April, 1824, relates the
following: “Our La Fayette has, it seems, given fresh
offence lately to the ultra-royalists, which the following
translation will explain. He had been summoned as a
witness on a trial; the crier being ordered to call over
the witnesses, the following scene occurred:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Crier.</em> The Marquis de La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Mr. La Fayette.</em> I beg to observe to the court, that in
the list of witnesses I am named by a title which, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the decree of the Constituent Assembly in 1791 (the
decree abolishing orders of nobility), I have ceased to
bear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>President of the Tribunal.</em> Crier, call Mr. La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This simple declaration has drawn down on the veteran
all the wrath of the ultra presses; and he has been
seriously accused of having in making it, violated the
charter or constitution. This notable instrument, it
seems, sets forth ‘that the ancient nobility resume their
rights’; and because the soldier of liberty refuses to
be confounded in title with the thousand little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>marquises</em></span>
about the court, he is charged with an offence against
the constitution of his country. The servile flatterers
of power, whether wielded by the self-made Corsican or
the son of St. Louis, may well rail at an example of consistency
which shames their rapid and oft-repeated tergiversations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be interesting to many to add, that on his examination
in giving his name and age, as is usual in
French trials, General La Fayette states himself to be
sixty-six years old.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We regretted at the time to observe in the resolutions
passed by Congress, that our early friend was mentioned
by his title, and we see the more reason to regret it now,
as it will furnish an occasion for the taunts of the
French press, as contrasted with the declaration above
stated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>ON the 12th of July, 1824, La Fayette, accompanied
by his son, George Washington, and his private secretary,
M. Levasseur, set sail from Havre for his last visit
to America. When the fact became known that La Fayette
contemplated this journey, the French police immediately
endeavored to spy out his motives for so
doing, to discover if they had any political significance.</p>

<p class='c010'>This incident is taken from a French paper:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“As soon as it was known that M. de La Fayette was
going to the United States, M. Delavau became anxious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>find out what preparations he was making for his departure,
and everything that passed in his hotel. For this
purpose a list of subscribers for the relief of an old officer
was forged, and to it were attached the names of
Messrs. Ternaux, Lafitte, Benjamin Constant, and other
deputies. A police officer named Placi was employed
on this occasion; and he called at the house of M. de
La Fayette, and saw M. Levasseur, his secretary, who
questioned him with great caution; and from the awkward
answers of the policeman discovered the trick. M.
Levasseur told him that M. de La Fayette was not within
at that moment, and if he would return in half an
hour he would be sure of meeting the general, who, no
doubt, would afford him every assistance in his power.
The policeman, confident of the success of his visit, returned
many thanks, and promised to come back at the
appointed time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“M. Levasseur ordered a servant to follow him, and he
was traced to a house where other police agents were
assembled; and they were heard congratulating each
other upon the capital breakfast which they could eat
the next morning at the expense of General La Fayette.
The policeman returned in half an hour, and was introduced
to M. de La Fayette, who received him in the
kindest manner, and addressed him thus:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Well, sir, what are you?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I am, sir,’ said the policeman, ‘an old officer, who
has been greatly persecuted.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Probably,’ said the general, ‘you belong to M. Delavau’s
regiment?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No,’ said Placi.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Well,’ continued the general, ‘as you will not tell
the truth, I will try and force you to do so.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general, then addressing himself to his secretary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>told him to order up the servants and direct them to
tie the policeman in a chaise, and carry him to his château
in the country and burn him. They obeyed the general’s
orders, and fastened Placi with cords in the post-chaise;
but soon as he saw it was no joke (not being
able to move hand or foot), he begged to be allowed to
speak a few words to the general; and on being brought
before him, threw himself upon his knees, and asked for
pardon, and at the same time delivering up the paper
which he had received as instructions. M. de La Fayette
granted him his liberty, and transmitted the instructions,
with a letter to M. Delavau, which the latter (of
course, through modesty) has not thought proper to
publish in the newspapers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The following account of the arrival of La Fayette in
America is taken from the files of the <cite>Niles Register</cite>, a
newspaper published in Baltimore at that time. The
date is August, 1824.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is with feelings of the utmost pleasure we announce
the arrival of this distinguished soldier and patriot of the
Revolution. He came a passenger in the <em>Cadmus</em> from
Havre, accompanied by his son, George Washington La
Fayette, and arrived at the quarantine ground, near New
York, on the 15th inst. He landed from the <em>Cadmus</em> at
an early hour in the morning, and repaired to the dwelling
of the Vice-President on Staten Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Immediately on his arrival being known, he was
waited on by a committee of the corporation of New
York and a great number of distinguished citizens. He
is in excellent health, full of conversation, and rejoiced
beyond measure in having his foot upon American
ground. On the following day he was conducted to the
city, amidst every demonstration of joy that a grateful
people could bestow, reflecting the highest credit on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>patriotic citizens of New York, and a just tribute to the
veteran whose blood and treasure so essentially contributed
to the enjoyment of our present blessings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The following interesting particulars are extracted from
the New York <cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The committee, having chartered the steamship <em>Robert
Fulton</em> and the steamboats <em>Chancellor Livingston</em>, <em>Oliver
Ellsworth</em>, <em>Henry Eckford</em>, <em>Connecticut</em>, <em>Bellona</em>, <em>Olive
Branch</em>, <em>Nautilus</em>, etc., they were all superbly dressed
with flags and streamers of every nation, and directed
to meet and form an aquatic escort between the south
part of the Battery and Governor’s Island, and thence
proceed in order to Staten Island. The squadron, bearing
six thousand of our fellow-citizens, majestically took
its course toward Staten Island, there to take on board
our long-expected and honored guest. At one o’clock the
fleet arrived at Staten Island, and in a few minutes a
landau was seen approaching the hotel near the ferry.
The general, the Vice-President, and ex-governor Ogden
of New Jersey having alighted, a procession was formed,
and the venerable stranger, supported by these gentlemen,
followed by all the officers of the island and
a crowd of citizens, passed through a triumphal arch,
round which was tastefully entwined the French and
American colors. He was here met by the committee of
the common council, who conducted him on board the
<em>Chancellor</em>. On entering this splendid vessel, the marines
paid him military honors. He was now introduced
to the committees from most of our honored associations
and the general officers representing the infantry. The
West Point band all this time were playing, ‘See! the
conquering hero comes,’ ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Ou peut on être mieux</em></span>,’ ‘Hail
Columbia,’ and the ‘Marseillaise Hymn.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The steamship now fired a salute, and the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>squadron got under way for the city. Decidedly the
most interesting sight was the reception of the general
by his old companions in arms, Colonel Marinus Willet,
now in his eighty-fifth year, General Van Cortland, General
Clarkson, and other Revolutionary worthies. He
knew and remembered them all. It was a reunion of a
long-separated family.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After the ceremony of embracing and congratulations
were over, he sat down alongside of Colonel Willet, who
grew young again and fought all his battles over. ‘Do
you remember,’ said he, ‘at the battle of Monmouth I
was a volunteer aid to General Scott? I saw you in the
heat of battle. You were but a boy; but you were a
serious and sedate lad.’ ‘Aye, aye; I remember well.
And on the Mohawk I sent you fifty Indians; and you
wrote that they set up such a yell that they frightened
the British horse, and they ran one way and the Indians
another.’ No person who witnessed this interview will
ever forget it; many an honest tear was shed on the
occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette landed amidst the cheers and acclamations
of 30,000 people, who filled the Castle, Battery,
and surrounding grounds within sight. After partaking
of some refreshment, the whole cavalcade moved in the
direction of the City Hall. The general rode uncovered,
and received the unceasing shouts and the congratulations
of 50,000 freemen, with tears and smiles, which
bespoke how deeply he felt the pride and glory of the
occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After the ceremonies of presentation at the City
Hall, he was conducted to his lodgings at the City
Hotel; and he had the extraordinary condescension
and good feeling to come out and shake hands with
six or seven hundred American youths, the future conservators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of his fame. This circumstance has planted
in the minds of these little ones the strongest affection
for the man, which will go with them through life and
endure till its close.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such is a faint outline of the proceedings of a day
which shines proudly in the annals of our country; proceedings
which were more brilliant than any that have
ever been witnessed in America, and which will rarely,
if ever, be equalled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Deputations from various cities called upon La Fayette:
among them was a deputation from the corporation
of Baltimore, to whose greeting La Fayette replied in expressive
terms. “Ah, Baltimore!” he exclaimed; “well
do I recollect Baltimore, and with feelings of peculiar
gratitude; for to the merchants of Baltimore, and particularly
to the ladies of Baltimore, I was indebted for
assistance which enabled me to open the Virginia campaign.
Without them, I do not know what I could have
done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General La Fayette visited the following places during
his triumphal journey through America, between the
time of his arrival in August, 1824, and his departure
in September, 1825, being received everywhere with the
warmest enthusiasm and honored with the most distinguished
attentions. At New York, Boston, Providence,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,—and, in
fact, everywhere,—he was honored with such ovations
as the country had never before witnessed. We can
only name the various cities which were honored by his
presence, and a few incidents which occurred. After
his reception at New York, he visited successively the
following places: Providence, Boston; then returned to
New York; and having been again received by crowds of
people whose desire to behold him was unabated, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>attended a splendid civic <span class='sc'>fête</span> at Castle Garden, and then
proceeded to visit West Point, Newburg, Poughkeepsie,
Clermont, Catskill, Hudson, Albany, Troy, Jersey City,
Newark, Elizabethtown, New Brunswick, Princeton,
Trenton, Morrisville, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Frenchtown,
Baltimore, Washington, Alexandria, Yorktown,
Williamsburg, Norfolk, Richmond, Fredericksburg, Monticello,
Charlottesville, Annapolis, from whence he returned
to Washington and Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>Magazine of American History</cite> of December,
1887, quotes the following description, taken from the
New York <cite>Evening Post</cite> of 1824, regarding the brilliant
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fête</em></span> given at Castle Garden on the 14th of September,
1824, in honor of the nation’s guest, General La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We hazard nothing in saying it was the most magnificent
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fête</em></span> given under cover in the world. It was a
festival that realizes all that we read of in the Persian
tales or Arabian Nights, which dazzled the eye and bewildered
the imagination, and which produced so many
powerful combinations by magnificent preparations as to
set description almost at defiance. We never saw ladies
more brilliantly dressed; everything that fashion and
elegance could devise was used on the occasion. Their
head-dresses were principally of flowers, with ornamented
combs, and some with plumes of ostrich feathers. White
and black lace dresses over satin were mostly worn, with
a profusion of steel ornaments, and neck chains of gold
and silver, suspended to which were beautiful gold and
silver badge medals bearing a likeness of La Fayette,
manufactured for the occasion. The gentlemen had suspended
from the button-holes of their coats a similar
likeness, and with the ladies, had the same stamped on
their gloves. A belt or sash with the likeness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>general, and entwined with a chaplet of roses, also
formed part of the dress of the ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Foreigners who were present admitted that they had
never seen anything equal to this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fête</em></span> in the several
countries from which they came, the blaze of light and
beauty, the decorations of the military officers, the combination
of rich colors which met the eye at every glance,
the brilliant circle of fashion in the galleries,—everything
in the range of sight being inexpressibly beautiful,
and doing great credit and honor to the managers and
all engaged in this novel spectacle. The guests numbered
several thousands; but there was abundant room
for the dancing, which commenced at an early hour and
was kept up until about three o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At a public dinner given to General La Fayette at
Westchester, Dr. Darlington, late member of Congress
from that district, offered the following classic toast:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>The Fields of Brandywine!</span> ... irrigated on the
<em>Cadmean</em> system of agriculture, with the blood of revolutionary
patriots ... the teeming harvest must ever be
<em>independent freemen</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>Niles Register</cite>, of Baltimore, gives the following
interesting descriptions of the reception of La Fayette
at Albany, and the memorable public welcome given him
by Congress:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“On alighting at the capitol, the general was conducted
to the senate chamber, where he was received by
the mayor and the members of the corporation. He
was addressed by the mayor of Albany, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Your visit in this country is received with universal
and heart-felt joy. Your claims upon the gratitude and
friendship of this nation arise from your heroic devotion
to its freedom, and your uniform assertion of the
rights of man. The progress of time has attested the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>purity of your character and the lustre of your heroism,
and the whole course of your life has evinced those
exalted virtues which were first displayed in favor of
the independence and liberty of America.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘In the hour of difficulty and peril, when America,
without allies, without credit, with an enfeebled government,
and with scanty means of resistance, confiding in
the justice of her cause, and the protection of Heaven,
was combating for her liberties against a nation powerful
in resources and all the materials of war, when our
prospects of success were considered by many more than
doubtful, if not desperate, you devoted all your energies
and all your means to our defence; and, after witnessing
our triumphant success, your life has been consecrated
to the vindication of the liberties of the Old World.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘When Franklin, the wisest man of the age, pronounced
you the most distinguished person he ever
knew; when Washington, the illustrious hero of the New
World, honored you with friendship the most sincere,
and with confidence the most unlimited, they evinced
their just discernment of character, and foresaw the further
display of faculties and virtues which would identify
your name with liberty, and demonstrate your well-founded
claims to the gratitude, the love, and the admiration
of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The few surviving statesmen and soldiers of the
Revolution have gathered around you as a friend and a
brother; the generation that has risen up since your
departure cherish the same feelings; and those that will
appear in the successive future ages will hail you as the
benefactor of America and the hero of liberty. In every
heart you have a friend, and your eulogium is pronounced
by every tongue. I salute you as an illustrious
benefactor of our country; and I supplicate the blessings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>of Heaven on a life sanctified in the sublime cause
of heroic virtue and disinterested benevolence.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>To which the general returned the following reply:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: The enjoyments of my visit to the beautiful
country and happy shores of the North River cannot
but be highly enhanced by the affectionate reception and
the civic testimonies of esteem which are conferred upon
me in this city, and the manner in which you are pleased
to express sentiments so gratifying to my heart. Not
half a century has elapsed since this place, ancient, but
small, was my headquarters, on the frontiers of an extensive
wilderness, since, as commander in the northern
department, I had to receive the oath of renunciation to
a royal distant government, of allegiance to the more
legitimate sovereignty of the people of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, sir, Albany, become a considerable city, is the
central seat of the authorities of the state of New York.
Those wildernesses rank among the most populous and
best cultivated parts of the Union. The rising generation
has, in two glorious wars, and still more so in her
admirable institutions, asserted an indisputable superiority
over the proud pretender to a control upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To these happy recollections, sir, you have the goodness
to add remembrances of my early admission among
the sons and soldiers of America, of friendships the
most honorable and dear to me. I will not attempt to
express the feelings that crowd on my mind, and shall
only beg you, sir, and the gentlemen of the corporation
to accept the tribute of my respectful and devoted gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The reception of La Fayette by Congress, in the Hall
of Representatives, was peculiarly flattering and gratifying.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“At an early hour the galleries began to fill with spectators;
and soon after eleven o’clock, many ladies entered
the hall and took possession of the sofas and seats
which were appropriated for their reception. The doors
were afterwards thrown open, and the Senate entered in
procession and took seats on the right side of the chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At one o’clock, George Washington La Fayette and
Colonel Levasseur, the general’s secretary, entered the
house, and took their seats on one of the sofas by the
side of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a few moments General La Fayette entered the
house, supported on his right by Mr. Mitchell, the chairman
of the select committee, and on his left by Mr. Livingston,
and followed by the committee. The speaker
and members then arose, and the procession advanced
towards the centre of the house. Mr. Mitchell introduced
La Fayette in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span class='sc'>Mr. Speaker</span>: The select committee, appointed
for that purpose, have the honor to introduce General
La Fayette to the House of Representatives.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general was then conducted to the sofa placed
for his reception, when the speaker, Mr. Clay, addressed
him in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span class='sc'>General</span>: The House of Representatives of the
United States, impelled alike by its own feelings and
by those of the whole American people, could not have
assigned to me a more gratifying duty than that of presenting
to you cordial congratulations upon the occasion
of your recent arrival in the United States, in compliance
with the wishes of Congress; and to assure you
of the very high satisfaction which your presence affords
on this early theatre of your glory and renown. Although
but few of the members who compose this body
shared with you in the war of our Revolution, all have,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>from impartial history, or from faithful tradition, a
knowledge of the perils, the sufferings, and the sacrifices
which you voluntarily encountered, and the signal services,
in America and in Europe, which you performed
for an infant, a distant, and an alien people; and all
feel and own the very great extent of the obligations
under which you have placed our country. But the relations
in which you have ever stood to the United
States, interesting and important as they have been, do
not constitute the only motive of the respect and admiration
which the House of Representatives entertain for
you. Your consistency of character, your uniform devotion
to regulated liberty, in all the vicissitudes of a long
and arduous life, also commands its admiration. During
all the recent convulsions of Europe, amidst, as after the
dispersion of every political storm, the people of the
United States have beheld you, true to your old principles,
firm and erect, cheering and animating, with your
well-known voice, the votaries of liberty, its faithful and
fearless champion, ready to shed the last drop of that
blood which here you so freely and nobly spilt in the
same holy cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The vain wish has been sometimes indulged that Providence
would allow the patriot after death to return to
his country and to contemplate the intermediate changes
which had taken place,—to view the forests felled, the
cities built, the mountains levelled, the canals cut, the
highways constructed, the progress of the arts, the advancement
of learning, and the increase of population.
General, your present visit to the United States is a
realization of the consoling object of that wish. You
are in the midst of posterity. Everywhere you must
have been struck with the great changes, physical and
moral, which have occurred since you left us. Even this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>very city, bearing a venerated name, alike endeared to
you and to us, has since emerged from the forest which
then covered its site. In one respect you behold us
unaltered, and this is in the sentiment of continued
devotion to liberty, and of ardent affection and profound
gratitude to your departed friend, the father of his
country, and to you, and to your illustrious associates
in the field and the cabinet, for the multiplied blessings
which surround us, and for the very privilege of addressing
you which I now exercise. This sentiment, now
fondly cherished by more than ten millions of people,
will be transmitted, with unabated vigor, down the tide
of time through the countless millions who are destined
to inhabit the continent to the latest posterity.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“While the speaker was addressing him, General La
Fayette was very visibly affected. At the close of the
address he seated himself for a moment to regain composure,
and then rose, and in tones made thrilling by
intense feeling, he made the following reply:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span class='sc'>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of
Representatives</span>: While the people of the United
States and their honorable representatives in Congress
have deigned to make a choice of me, one of the American
veterans, to signify in his person their esteem for
our joint services and their attachment to the principles
for which we have had the honor to fight and bleed, I
am proud and happy to share those extraordinary favors
with my dear Revolutionary companions; yet it would
be, on my part, uncandid and ungrateful not to acknowledge
my personal share in those testimonies of kindness,
as they excite in my breast emotions which no words are
adequate to express.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘My obligations to the United States, sir, far exceed
any merit I might claim; they date from the time when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>I had the happiness to be adopted as a young soldier a
favored son of America; they have been continued to
me during almost a half-century of constant affection and
confidence; and now, sir, thanks to your most gratifying
invitation, I find myself greeted by a series of welcomes,
one hour of which would more than compensate for the
public exertions and sufferings of a whole life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The approbation of the American people and their
representatives for my conduct during the vicissitudes
of the European revolution is the highest reward I could
receive. Well may I <em>stand firm and erect</em>, when in their
names, and by you, Mr. Speaker, I am declared to have
in every instance been faithful to those American principles
of liberty, equality, and true social order, the
devotion to which, as it has been from my earliest youth,
so it shall continue to be to my latest breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You have been pleased, Mr. Speaker, to allude to the
peculiar felicity of my situation, when, after so long an
absence, I am called to witness the immense improvements,
the admirable communications, the prodigious creations,
of which we find an example in this city, whose
name itself is a venerated palladium. In a word, all the
grandeur and prosperity of those happy United States,
who, at the same time they nobly secure the complete
assertion of American independence, reflect on every part
of the world the light of a far superior civilization.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘What better pledge can be given of a persevering
national love of liberty, when those blessings are evidently
the result of a virtuous resistance to oppression,
and institutions founded on the rights of men and the
republican principle of self-government?</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No, Mr. Speaker, posterity has not begun for me,
since, in the sons of my companions and friends I find
the same public feelings, and, permit me to add, the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>feelings in my behalf which I have had the happiness to
experience in their fathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Sir, I have been allowed, forty years ago, before a
committee of a congress of thirteen states, to express
the fond wishes of an American heart; on this day I
have the honor and enjoy the delight to congratulate the
representatives of the Union, so vastly enlarged, on the
realization of those wishes, even beyond every human
expectation, and upon the almost infinite prospects we
can with certainty anticipate; permit me, Mr. Speaker,
and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, to join
to the expression of those sentiments a tribute of my
lively gratitude, affectionate devotion, and profound respect.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Both the address of the speaker of the House, and
the reply of General La Fayette, were listened to with
the most intense and admiring attention. As soon as
the general had concluded his reply, Mr. Mitchell moved
that the House should adjourn. After the adjournment,
the speaker left his chair, and advancing to General La
Fayette, offered his personal congratulations, while shaking
him warmly by the hand. The members of the
House were then introduced individually to their honored
guest, by the speaker, and after some time spent in
receiving and shaking hands with those who pressed forward
to claim the honor of thus welcoming personally
the distinguished guest of the nation, General La Fayette
retired, bearing with him the admiring devotion and
profoundest love of the people of his adopted country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding an incident which occurred during La Fayette’s
last journey in America, the <cite>Niles Register</cite> says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“To preserve, in some small degree, an account of the
<em>feelings</em> which the arrival of our venerable friend has elicited,
we have noticed a few of the exhibitions of it that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>have taken place, but every narrative of them falls far
short of the reality of what has happened. The people
are wild with joy, and the gratitude and love of all persons,
of every age, sex, and condition, seems hardly to
be restrained within the bounds of propriety—as if it
would cause many to forget what was due to themselves
and the general, whom they delight to honor. At one
place they failed so far in self-respect as to contend with
<em>horses</em> for the privilege of drawing the Revolutionary
chief in his carriage! It is hoped that the general will
not be thus <em>insulted</em> again—for insulted he must be,
when he sees the sovereigns of this great and glorious
country aiming at the most magnificent destinies, converted
into asses or other beasts of burden. It is his
desire to be treated like a <em>man</em>, not as a titled knave or
brainless dandy. Let him be hugged to the heart of all
who can approach him, so far as not to endanger his
health, and incur the risk of ‘killing him with kindness’—let
the trumpet to the cannon speak, the cannon to
the heavens, and the ardent prayers of free millions
ascend to the throne of the Omnipotent, that blessings
may be heaped upon him; but, in all this, let us remember
that we are <em>men</em> like unto himself and <em>republicans</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the many interesting incidents of La Fayette’s
tour in America given by his secretary, M. Levasseur, in
a work entitled “La Fayette in America,” we have space
for only three or four. M. Levasseur thus recounts an
incident of their visit to Ex-President Monroe:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“General La Fayette was daily making preparations
for his return to Europe, but before leaving the soil of
America he was anxious to revisit some of his old
friends in Virginia, and especially he desired to see
him who, as chief magistrate, had received him at the
seat of government, and who, now retired to private life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>continued in cultivating his moderate patrimonial estate,
to give his fellow-citizens an example of every virtue.
The general mentioned his wish to President Adams,
who immediately offered to accompany him in the visit,
saying that ‘he would gladly avail himself of such an
occasion to go and offer to his predecessor his tribute of
respect and attachment.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the 6th of August, accordingly, we started for
Oak-hill, the residence of Mr. Monroe, thirty-seven miles
from Washington. Mr. Adams took the general in his
carriage, together with George La Fayette and one of his
friends; I followed in a tilbury with a son of the President,
and thus, without suite or escort, we left the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the bridge over the Potomac we stopped to pay
toll—the toll-gatherer, after counting the number of
persons and horses, received from the President the sum
required and we went on; scarcely, however, had we
proceeded a few steps when we heard behind us a voice,
saying, ‘Mr. President, Mr. President, you have paid me
a shilling short!’ and immediately the toll-gatherer came
running up with the money in his hand, explaining how
the mistake arose. The President heard him attentively,
went over the calculation with him, and finding that the
man was right, put his hand out to pay him, when all at
once the toll-gatherer recognized General La Fayette in
the carriage, and forthwith insisted upon returning the
amount of his toll, saying, ‘All bridges and all gates are
free to the Guest of the Nation.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Adams, however, observed that on this occasion
the general was not travelling officially nor as the Guest
of the Nation, but simply as an individual and a friend
of the President, which character gave him no title to
exemption. This reasoning struck the toll-gatherer as
just: he took the money and withdrew. Thus during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>the whole course of his travels in the United States
the general was once only subject to the customary tolls,
and that was precisely on the occasion when he was accompanied
by the chief magistrate of the nation—a circumstance
which in any other country would probably
have insured him the privilege of exemption.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding this incident a writer remarks:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do not know how this simple narrative may strike
others, but to us it affords a more remarkable illustration
of the simplicity and real equality resulting from our
institutions than the most elaborate argument could do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Levasseur also thus relates the visit of La Fayette
to General Jackson at the Hermitage:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At one o’clock we embarked with a numerous company
to go to dine with General Jackson, residing at the
distance of some miles up the river. We there found
many ladies and neighboring farmers who had been invited
by Mrs. Jackson to come and take part in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fête</em></span>
she had prepared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first thing that struck me on arriving at the
residence of General Jackson was the simplicity of his
habitation. Still a little governed by my European
habits, I demanded if this could really be the dwelling
of the most popular man in the United States; of him
whom the country proclaimed one of its most illustrious
defenders; and in fine, of him who, by the will of the
people, had been on the point of arriving at the supreme
magistracy!</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Jackson showed us, in all their details, his
garden and his farm, which appeared to be cultivated
with the greatest intelligence. We remarked everywhere
the greatest order and the most perfect prosperity, and
might readily have believed ourselves with one of the
richest and most skilful farmers of Germany.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>
<img src='images/i-410.jpg' alt='Andrew Jackson' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“On re-entering the house, some friends of General
Jackson, who probably had not seen him for a long time,
begged him to show them the arms that he had received
after the last war. He yielded with a good grace to
their request, and caused to be placed on the table a
sabre, a sword, and a pair of pistols. The sword was
presented to him by Congress, and the sabre, I believe,
by the body of the army who fought under his orders at
New Orleans. These two arms of American manufacture
are remarkable for the elegance of the workmanship,
and yet more for the honorable inscriptions with
which they are covered. But it was particularly to the
pistols that the general wished to draw our attention.
He presented them to General La Fayette, and asked
if he recollected them. The latter, after some moments
of attentive examination, answered that he did remember
them to be those which he had offered in 1778 to his paternal
friend Washington, and that he experienced sincere
satisfaction in now finding them in the hands of a man
so worthy of such an inheritance. At these words the
countenance of Old Hickory was suffused with a modest
blush, and his eyes sparkled as in the days of victory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I believe myself worthy of it’ (pressing
at the same time to his bosom his pistols and the
hands of La Fayette), ‘if not for what I have done, at
least for what I desire to do for my country.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the citizens applauded this noble confidence of
the patriot-hero, and felt convinced that the arms of
Washington could not be in better hands than those of
Jackson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the most impressive scene pictured by M. Levasseur
is the following description of La Fayette’s visit to
the tomb of Washington:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leaving Washington and descending the Potomac,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>after a voyage of two hours, the guns of Fort Washington
announced that we were approaching the last abode
of the Father of his Country. At this solemn signal, to
which the military band accompanying us responded by
plaintive strains, we went on deck, and the venerable soil
of Mount Vernon was before us; at this view an involuntary
and spontaneous movement made us kneel. We
landed in boats and trod upon the ground so often worn
by the feet of Washington. A carriage received General
La Fayette, and the other visitors silently ascended the
precipitous path which conducted to the solitary habitation
of Mount Vernon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Three nephews of General Washington took La
Fayette, his son, and myself, to conduct us to the tomb
of their uncle; our numerous companions remained in
the house; in a few minutes after, the cannon of the fort,
thundering anew, announced that <span class='sc'>La Fayette</span> rendered
homage to the ashes of <span class='sc'>Washington</span>. Simple and modest
as he was during life, the tomb of the citizen-hero is
scarcely perceived amid the sombre cypresses by which
it is surrounded. A vault slightly elevated and sodded
over, a wooden door without inscriptions, some withered
and some green garlands, indicate to the traveller who
visits this spot the place where rest in peace the puissant
arms which broke the chains of his country. As we approached,
the door was opened, La Fayette descended
alone into the vault, and a few minutes after re-appeared
with his eyes overflowing with tears. He took his son
and me by the hand and led us into the tomb, where by
a sign he indicated the coffin of his paternal friend,
alongside of which was that of his companion in life,
united to him in the grave. We knelt reverently near
his coffin, which we respectfully saluted with our lips,
and rising, threw ourselves into the arms of La Fayette,
and mingled our tears with his.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>On the 1st of January, 1825, a dinner was given to
General La Fayette by the members of both houses of
Congress. The scene is thus described by one of the
Washington papers:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At half-past four o’clock the front rooms of Williamson’s
buildings, now occupied by private families, were
thrown open for the company, having been politely tendered
for that purpose. In about half an hour afterwards
the President of the United States entered the
room accompanied by his secretaries. At half-past five
General La Fayette arrived attended by his son, Mr.
George Washington La Fayette, and his secretary, M.
Levasseur; and at six o’clock the company (which, including
the invited guests, amounted to about two
hundred) sat down to dinner. Mr. Gaillard, the president
<em>pro tem.</em> of the Senate, and Mr. Clay, the speaker
of the House of Representatives, presided. On the right
of Mr. Gaillard sat the President of the United States,
and on his left General La Fayette, <em>supported by his Revolutionary
brethren</em>. On the right of Mr. Clay sat the Secretary
of State, and on his left the Secretary of War.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The hall was adorned with pictures and flags arranged
with elegance and taste. The flags from the war and
navy departments were obtained for the occasion, and
contributed to revive in the mind associations dear to the
heart of every American.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Among many toasts we can only mention the one to
the memory of Washington, and the following to La
Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“General La Fayette, the great apostle of rational liberty.
Unawed by the frowns of tyranny, uninfluenced
by the blandishments of wealth, and unseduced by popular
applause; the same in the castle of Olmütz, as in
the active scenes of his labor and height of his renown.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>After this toast was drunk, General La Fayette rose
and thus responded:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen of both Houses</span>: I want words to express
the respectful, grateful sense I have of all the
favors and kindnesses you are pleased to confer upon me.
I hope you will do justice to the warm feelings of an
American heart, and I beg leave to propose the following
toast:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Perpetual union among the United States—it has
saved us in our time of danger—it will save the world.</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>This toast was received with the wildest enthusiasm,
and after many others in behalf of the army, navy, people
of America, free press, etc., the distinguished guests
withdrew.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the first day of January, 1825, a joint committee
of both Houses waited upon General La Fayette, and
presented to him a copy of the following act of Congress
concerning him:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America, in Congress assembled</em>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“That in consideration of the services and sacrifices of General
La Fayette in the War of the Revolution, the Secretary of
the Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized to pay to him the
sum of two hundred thousand dollars, out of any money in the
treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 2.</span> <em>And be it further enacted</em>, That there be granted to
the said General La Fayette and his heirs one township of
land; to be laid out and located under the authority of the
President, on any of the unappropriated lands of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>The address of the committee was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>General</span>: We are a committee of the Senate and
House of Representatives charged with the office of informing
you of the passage of an act, a copy of which we
now present. You will perceive from this act, sir, that
the two Houses of Congress, aware of the large pecuniary
as well as other sacrifices which your long and arduous devotion
to the cause of freedom has cost you, have deemed
it their privilege to reimburse a portion of them, as having
been incurred in part on account of the United States.
The principles which have marked your character will
not permit you to oppose any objection to the discharge
of so much of the national obligation to you as admits of
it. We are directed to express to you the confidence as
well as request of the two Houses of Congress that you
will, by an acquiescence in their wishes in this respect,
add another to the many signal proofs you have afforded
of your esteem for a people whose esteem for you can
never cease until they have ceased to prize the liberty
they enjoy, and to venerate the virtues by which it was
acquired. We have only to subjoin an expression of our
gratification in being the organs of this communication,
and of the distinguished personal respect with which we
are,</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen of the Committee of both Houses of

<p class='c010'>“The immense and unexpected gift which, in addition

the treasures in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However proud I am of every sort of obligation received
from the people of the United States, and their

most grateful reverence. But the so very kind resolutions
of both Houses delivered by you, gentlemen, in
terms of equal kindness, precludes all other sentiments
except those of the lively and profound gratitude, of
which, in respectfully accepting the munificent favor, I

<p class='c009'>“AN interesting ceremony took place at Washington
a day or two before the departure of the
Nation’s Guest. This was the presentation to the
representative of the Columbian Republic certain presents
to be forwarded by him to Bolivar, the Liberator.
The presents consisted of a medal of gold presented to
Lady Washington by the city of Williamsburg, in honor
of her illustrious husband, and also a portrait of General
Washington, inclosing in the back of the picture a lock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>of the patriarch’s hair. These gifts were presented by
George Washington P. Custis, by the honored hands of
the last of the generals of the army of North American
independence—General La Fayette. The following is a
translation of the letter written by General La Fayette
to the president, Liberator Bolivar, which, together with
a letter from George Washington Custis, accompanied
the gifts.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>President Liberator</span>: My religious and filial devotion
to the memory of General Washington could not
be better appreciated in his family than by the honorable
charge now bestowed upon me. While I recognize
the perfect likeness of the portrait, I am happy to think
that among all existing characters, and all those recorded
in history, General Bolivar is the one to whom my paternal
friend would have preferred to offer it. What
shall I say more to the great citizen whom South America
has hailed by the name of liberator, a name confirmed
by both worlds, and who, possessing an influence equal
to his disinterestedness, carries in his heart the love
of liberty, without any exception, and of the republic,
without any alloy? However, I feel authorized by
the public and recent testimonies of your kindness and
esteem to present you with the personal congratulation
of a veteran of our common cause, who, on the eve
of his departure for another hemisphere, shall follow
with his best wishes the glorious complement of your
labors, and that solemn congress at Panama where will be
consolidated and completed all the principles and all the
interests of American independence, freedom, and policy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Accept, President Liberator, the homage of my deep
and respectful attachment.</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>To which letter La Fayette subsequently received the
following reply:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Lima</span>, March 16, 1826.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>General</span>: For the first time I behold the characters
traced by the hand of the benefactor of the New World.
I owe that happiness to Colonel Mesh, who has just
handed me your honorable of the 13th October last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is with inexpressible pleasure that I learned from
the public papers that you had had the goodness to
honor me with a treasure from Mount Vernon. The
likeness of Washington, and one of the monuments of
his glory, are, it is said, to be presented to me by you in
the name of the illustrious citizen’s eldest son of liberty
in the New World. How shall I express the value which
my heart attaches to a testimony of esteem so glorious
for me? The family of Mount Vernon honor me beyond
my hopes; for Washington, from the hands of
La Fayette, is the most sublime recompense that man
could desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Washington was the courageous protector of social
reform, and you, sir, you are the heroic citizen, the
champion of liberty, who served America with the one
hand, and the Old World with the other. What mortal
could suppose himself worthy of the honor with which
you deign to overwhelm me? Hence my confusion is
in proportion with the extent of gratitude, which I offer
to you with the respect and veneration which every man
owes to the Nestor of liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am, with the greatest consideration, your respectful
admirer,</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Bolivar</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>Niles Register</cite> of September 3, 1825, says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“General La Fayette will commence his return voyage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>to Europe, by proceeding to the new and splendid
frigate <em>Brandywine</em>, on the 8th inst., which now lies in
the Potomac; and millions of wishes will be offered up
that he may have prosperous gales and pleasant weather,
and a happy meeting with his friends, a long life of
serenity and peace, and a triumphant exit from this
world to that which is to come. Highly favored man—who
hast thyself seen and felt all that grateful posterity
can confer for imperishable deeds of virtue, farewell!—and,
if so it shall yet be that the evening of thy days
and thy night of death are passed in this land of the
free, every house will be open to receive thee, or every
heart be engaged to invoke eternal blessings upon
thee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From the same paper, dated September 10, we quote
the following:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette has departed. He left Washington on
Wednesday last in the steamboat <em>Mount Vernon</em>, and in
due season reached the new frigate <em>Brandywine</em> lying at
the mouth of the Potomac, which was also visited by the
steamboat <em>Constitution</em>, from Baltimore, with a large
party of gentlemen. All was done that could be done
to honor the Nation’s Guest, and the people were not
less zealous to show their affection for him on the day
of his departure, than to press about him on that of his
arrival among us more than a year ago. For some time
past he had made his home with the President, from
whom and all else he received every civility and kindness
that it was possible, by those who loved him the
more the better they knew him, to bestow upon him.
We shall give some of the particulars of the ceremonies
and proceedings that took place on the interesting occasion.
The parting in the grand hall of the President’s
house filled with citizens and officers, on Wednesday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>last, is described as one of the most sublime and affecting
scenes that can be imagined. The President’s address
to him is a composition worthy of the occasion;
he delivered it with great emotion, yet with much dignity;
but hardly one was present who did not feel the
tears moistening his eyes or trickling down his cheeks,
and many will be in like manner affected even when
they <em>read</em> it. La Fayette’s reply is also eloquent and
abounds with feeling. The silence of the grave prevailed
while either was speaking. When the latter had
ended he gave vent to his tears with embraces, and all
partook of his emotions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last three weeks which the Nation’s Guest
spent in our happy land were exceedingly well appropriated.
After witnessing the magnificent ceremony at
Boston on the anniversary of the battle of Bunker
Hill, he leisurely returned to the city of Washington,
visiting many of his personal friends on the way, and
reviewing the battle-field at Brandywine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the city of Washington he made delightful
excursions into Virginia, in which it happened that
three out of all the Presidents which we have had yet,
reside as citizens.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last days of his visit were properly spent by La
Fayette in the nation’s house, on the invitation of its
present possessor, the chief magistrate of the United
States. Mr. Adams was in his early youth a favorite
with the general, having much personal communication
with him; and of his disposition and ability to represent
the hospitality and feeling of the millions of free people
over whose affairs he presides there could not be a doubt.
La Fayette was at home in the national house, in the
city of Washington, and in the heart of a family which
offered every inducement that can operate on the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>mind to make him comfortable: this was his abode till
the moment of his departure to embark in the <em>Brandywine</em>,
named in compliment to him, and peculiarly fitted
for his accommodation—her ‘giddy mast’ bearing the
stripes and the stars, her bosom to contain the person
of our guest; a man of whom it may be said, ‘take him
all in all, we ne’er shall look upon his like again,’ unless
he shall again visit our shores; one who was the same,
great and good, in prosperity and adversity—grateful
for kind offices, forgiving of injuries, zealous to confer
benefits, modest when on the pinnacle of human glory,
dignified and collected in the proud presence of kings.
But I must not proceed—if, after Mr. Adams’ display
of eloquence and power, he who commands words and
they obey him, honestly confessed ‘a want of language
to give utterance to his feelings’—who among us may
attempt it? I shall, therefore, proceed to notice some
of the things which happened at the departure of La
Fayette, with this simple remark, that if there is any
American who can read, unmoved, Mr. Adams’ valedictory
address to him, or the reply of the general to that
address, I would not possess that man’s heart for his
fortune though he were a Cr&oelig;sus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The 7th inst. was the day appointed for his departure.
The civil and military authorities and the whole
people of Washington had prepared to honor it. The
banks were closed and all business suspended, and
nothing else engaged attention except the ceremonies
prescribed for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At about twelve o’clock the authorities of Washington,
Georgetown, and Alexandria, the principal officers
of the general government, civil, military, and naval,
some members of Congress, and other respectable strangers
were assembled in the President’s house to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>leave of La Fayette. He entered the great hall in
silence, leaning on the marshal of the district and on
the arm of one of the President’s sons. Mr. Adams then
with much dignity, but with evident emotion, addressed
him in the following terms:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c029'>”<em>Address of the President of the United States to General
La Fayette, on taking leave of him at his departure
on the 7th of September, 1825.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>“‘<span class='sc'>General La Fayette</span>: It has been the good fortune
of many of my distinguished fellow-citizens, during the
course of the year now elapsed, upon your arrival at
their respective places of abode, to greet you with the
welcome of the nation. The less pleasing task now
devolves upon me, of bidding you, in the name of the
nation, adieu.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It were no longer seasonable, and would be superfluous,
to recapitulate the remarkable incidents of your
early life—incidents which associated your name, fortunes,
and reputation in imperishable connection with
the independence and history of the North American
Union.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The part which you performed at that important
juncture was marked with characters so peculiar, that,
realizing the fairest fable of antiquity, its parallel could
scarcely be found in the <em>authentic</em> records of human history.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You deliberately and perseveringly preferred toil,
danger, the endurance of every hardship, and the privation
of every comfort, in defence of a holy cause, to
inglorious ease, and the allurements of rank, affluence,
and unrestrained youth, at the most splendid and fascinating
court of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘That this choice was not less wise than magnanimous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the sanction of half a century, and the gratulations
of unnumbered voices, all unable to express the gratitude
of the heart with which your visit to this hemisphere
has been welcomed, afford ample demonstration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘When the contest of Freedom, to which you had
repaired as a voluntary champion, had closed, by the
complete triumph of her cause in this country of your
adoption, you returned to fulfil the duties of the philanthropist
and patriot in the land of your nativity. There,
in a consistent and undeviating career of forty years,
you have maintained, through every vicissitude of
alternate success and disappointment, the same glorious
cause to which the first years of your active life had
been devoted,—the improvement of the moral and political
condition of man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Throughout that long succession of time, the people
of the United States, for whom and with whom you had
fought the battles of liberty, have been living in the full
possession of its fruits—one of the happiest among the
family of nations. Spreading in population; enlarging
in territory; acting and suffering according to the condition
of their nature; and laying the foundations of the
greatest, and, we humbly hope, the most beneficent
power that ever regulated the concerns of man upon
earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘In the lapse of forty years, the generation of men
with whom you co-operated in the conflict of arms has
nearly passed away. Of the general officers of the American
army in that war, you alone survive; of the sages
who guided our councils; of the warriors who met the
foe in the field or upon the wave, with the exception of
a few, to whom unusual length of days has been allotted
by Heaven, all now sleep with their fathers. A succeeding,
and even a third, generation have arisen to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>their places; and their children’s children, while rising
up to call them blessed, have been taught by them, as
well as admonished by their own constant enjoyment of
freedom, to include in every benison upon their fathers,
the name of him who came from afar, with them, and in
their cause to conquer or to fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The universal prevalence of these sentiments was
signally manifested by a resolution of Congress, representing
the whole people, and all the states of this Union,
requesting the President of the United States to communicate
to you the assurances of grateful and affectionate
attachment of this government and people, and
desiring that a national ship might be employed at your
convenience, for your passage to the borders of our
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The invitation was transmitted to you by my venerable
predecessor; himself bound to you by the strongest
ties of personal friendship; himself one of those whom
the highest honors of his country had rewarded for blood
early shed in her cause, and for a long life of devotion
to her welfare. By him the services of a national ship
were placed at your disposal. Your delicacy preferred a
more private conveyance, and a full year has elapsed since
you landed upon our shores. It were scarcely an exaggeration
to say that it has been to the people of the
Union a year of uninterrupted festivity and enjoyment,
inspired by your presence. You have traversed the
twenty-four states of this great confederacy. You have
been received with rapture by the survivors of your
earliest companions in arms. You have been hailed as a
long-absent parent by their children, the men and women
of the present age; and a rising generation, the hope of
future time, in numbers surpassing the whole population
of that day when you fought at the head, and by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>side of their forefathers, have vied with the scanty remnants
of that hour of trial, in acclamations of joy at
beholding the face of him whom they feel to be the
common benefactor of all. You have heard the mingled
voices of the past, the present, and the future age, joining
in one universal chorus of delight at your approach;
and the shouts of unbidden thousands, which greeted
your landing on the soil of freedom, have followed every
step of your way, and still resound, like the rushing of
many waters, from every corner of our land.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You are now about to return to the country of your
birth, of your ancestors, of your posterity. The executive
government of the Union, stimulated by the same
feeling which had prompted the Congress to the designation
of a national ship for your accommodation in coming
hither, has destined the first service of a frigate
recently launched at the metropolis, to the less welcome
but equally distinguished trust, of conveying you home.
The name of the ship has added one more memorial to
distant regions and to future ages, of a stream already
memorable at once in the story of your sufferings and
of our independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The ship is now prepared for your reception, and
equipped for sea. From the moment of her departure,
the prayers of millions will ascend to Heaven, that her
passage may be prosperous, and your return to the bosom
of your family as propitious to your happiness as your
visit to this scene of your youthful glory has been to
that of the American people.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Go, then, our beloved friend; return to the land of
brilliant genius, of generous sentiment, of heroic valor;
to that beautiful France, the nursing mother of the
twelfth Louis, and the fourth Henry; to the native soil
of Bayard and Coligni, of Turenne and Catinat, of Fénélon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and d’Aguesseau. In that illustrious catalogue of
names which she claims as of her children, and with
honest pride holds up to the admiration of other nations,
the name of La Fayette has already for centuries been
enrolled. And it shall henceforth burnish into brighter
fame; for if, in after days, a Frenchman shall be called
to indicate the character of his nation by that of one
individual during the age in which we live, the blood of
lofty patriotism shall mantle in his cheek, the fire of
conscious virtue shall sparkle in his eye, and he shall
pronounce the name of <span class='sc'>La Fayette</span>. Yet we, too, and
our children, in life and after death, shall claim you
for our own. You are ours by that more than patriotic
self-devotion with which you flew to the aid of our
fathers at the crisis of their fate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Ours by that long series of years in which you have
cherished us in your regard. Ours by that unshaken
sentiment of gratitude for your services which is a precious
portion of our inheritance. Ours by that tie of
love, stronger than death, which has linked your name for
the endless ages of time, with the name of Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘At the painful moment of parting from you, we take
comfort in the thought, that wherever you may be, to
the last pulsation of your heart, our country will be ever
present to your affections; and a cheering consolation
assures us that we are not called to sorrow most of all,
that we shall see your face no more. We shall indulge
the pleasing anticipation of beholding our friend again.
In the meantime, speaking in the name of the whole
people of the United States, and at a loss only for language
to give utterance to that feeling of attachment
with which the heart of the nation beats as the heart of
one man—I bid you a reluctant and affectionate farewell.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>“To which General La Fayette made the following answer:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Amidst all my obligations to the general government,
and particularly to you, sir, its respected chief magistrate,
I have most thankfully to acknowledge the opportunity
given me, at this solemn and painful moment, to
present the people of the United States with a parting
tribute of profound, inexpressible gratitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘To have been, in the infant and critical days of these
states, adopted by them as a favorite son, to have participated
in the toils and perils of our unspotted struggle
for independence, freedom, and equal rights, and in the
foundation of the American era of a new social order,
which has already pervaded this, and must for the dignity
and happiness of mankind successfully pervade
every part of the other hemisphere, to have received at
every stage of the Revolution, and during forty years
after that period, from the people of the United States
and their representatives at home and abroad, continual
marks of their confidence and kindness, has been the
pride, the encouragement, the support of a long and
eventful life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘But how could I find words to acknowledge that series
of welcomes, those unbounded and universal displays of
public affection, which have marked each step, each hour,
of a twelve months’ progress through the twenty-four
states, and which, while they overwhelm my heart with
grateful delight, have most satisfactorily evinced the
concurrence of the people in the kind testimonies, in the
immense favors bestowed on me by the several branches
of their representatives, in every part and at the central
seat of the confederacy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Yet gratifications still higher awaited me: in the
wonders of creation and improvement that have met my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>enchanted eye; in the unparalleled and self-felt happiness
of the people, in their rapid prosperity and insured security,
public and private, in a practice of good order,—the
appendage of true freedom,—and a national good sense,—the
final arbiter of all difficulties,—I have had proudly to
recognize a result of the republican principles for which we
have fought, and a glorious demonstration to the most
timid and prejudiced minds of the superiority, over degrading
aristocracy or despotism, of popular institutions
founded on the plain rights of man, and where the local
rights of every section are preserved under a constitutional
bond of union. The cherishing of that union between
the states, as it has been the farewell entreaty of
our great paternal Washington, and will ever have the
dying prayer of every American patriot, so it has become
the sacred pledge of the emancipation of the world, an
object in which I am happy to observe that the American
people, while they give the animating example of
successful free institutions in return for an evil entailed
upon them by Europe, and of which a liberal and enlightened
sense is everywhere more and more generally
felt, show themselves every day more anxiously interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘And now, sir, how can I do justice to my deep and
lively feelings for the assurances, most peculiarly valued,
of your esteem and friendship; for your so very kind
references to old times, to my beloved associates, to
the vicissitudes of my life; for your affecting picture of
the blessings poured by the several generations of the
American people on the remaining days of a delighted
veteran; for your affectionate remarks on this sad hour
of separation, on the country of my birth, full, I can say,
of American sympathies; on the hope so necessary to me
of my seeing again the country that has deigned, near a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>half-century ago, to call me hers? I shall content myself,
refraining from superfluous repetitions, at once, before
you, sir, and this respected circle, to proclaim my
cordial confirmation of every one of the sentiments
which I have had daily opportunities publicly to utter;
from the time when your venerable predecessor, my old
brother in arms and friend, transmitted to me the honorable
invitation of Congress; to this day, when you, my
dear sir, whose friendly connection with me dates from
your earliest youth, are going to consign me to the protection,
across the Atlantic, of the heroic national flag, on
board the splendid ship, the name of which has been not
the least flattering and kind among the numberless favors
conferred upon me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘God bless you, sir, and all who surround us. God
bless the American people, each of their states, and the
federal government. Accept this patriotic farewell of
an overflowing heart; such will be its last throb when
it ceases to beat.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the last sentence was pronounced,” says the <cite>National
Intelligencer</cite>, “the general advanced, and, while
the tears poured over his venerable cheeks, again took
the President in his arms. He retired a few paces, but,
overcome by his feelings, again returned, and uttering in
broken accents, ‘God bless you!’ fell once more on the
neck of Mr. Adams. It was a scene at once solemn and
moving, as the sighs and stealing tears of many who
witnessed it bore testimony. Having recovered his
self-possession, the general stretched out his hands, and
was, in a moment, surrounded by the greetings of the
whole assembly, who pressed upon him, each eager to
seize, perhaps for the last time, that beloved hand which
was opened so freely for our aid, when aid was so precious,
and which grasped, with firm and undeviating hold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the steel which so bravely helped to achieve our deliverance.
The expression which now beamed from the
face of this exalted man was of the finest and most
touching kind. The hero was lost in the father and the
friend: dignity melted into subdued affection, and the
friend of Washington seemed to linger with a mournful
delight among the sons of his adopted country. A considerable
period was then occupied in conversing with
various individuals, while refreshments were presented
to the company. The moment of departure at length
arrived, and having once more pressed the hand of Mr.
Adams, he entered the barouche accompanied by the
secretaries of state, of the treasury, and of the navy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another writer says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The parting being over, the carriage of the general,
preceded by the cavalry, the marine corps, and Captain
Edwards’ rifle corps, and followed by the carriages containing
the corporate authorities of the cities, of the
district, and numerous military and high civil officers of
the government, moved forward, followed by the remaining
military companies. In taking up the escort the
whole column moved through the court in front of the
President’s mansion, and paid him the passing salute as
he stood in front to receive it. The whole scene—the
peals of artillery, the animating sound of numerous military
bands, the presence of the vast concourse of people,
and the occasion that assembled them—altogether produced
emotions not easily described, but which every
American will readily conceive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On reaching the bank of the Potomac, near where
the <em>Mount Vernon</em> steam vessel was in waiting, all the
carriages in the procession, except the general’s, wheeled
off, and the citizens in them assembled on foot around
that of the general. The whole military body then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>passed him in review, as he stood in the barouche of the
President, attended by the secretaries of state, of the
treasury, and of the navy. After the review, the general
proceeded to the steam vessel, under a salute of artillery,
surrounded by as many citizens, all eager to catch the
last look, as could press on the large wharf; and at four
o’clock, this great and good and extraordinary man
trod for the last time the soil of America, followed by
the blessings of every patriotic heart that lives on it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the vessel moved off, and for a short time after,
the deepest silence was observed by the whole of the
vast multitude that lined the shore. The feeling that
pervaded them was that of children bidding a final farewell
to a venerated parent. The crowd remained gazing
after the retiring vessel, until she had passed Greenleaf’s
Point, where another salute repeated the valedictory
sounds of respect, and these again were, not long after,
echoed by the heavy guns of Fort Washington, and
reminded us of the rapidity with which this benefactor
and friend of our country was borne from it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general was accompanied to the <em>Brandywine</em> by
the Secretary of the Navy, the mayors of the three cities
of the district, the commander-in-chief of the army, the
generals of the militia of the district, Commodore Bainbridge,
Mr. Custis, of Arlington, and several other gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The trip to the <em>Brandywine</em>, and the ceremonies on
board of the frigate on the reception of the general, are
thus described by one of the passengers in the steamboat
<em>Mount Vernon</em>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The moment of separation arrived. The <em>Mount Vernon</em>
received her venerable freight, and the general, from
the midst of the suite, whom the government had detailed
as an escort of honor, waved his hand and bowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>to the thousands who thronged the shores, an affectionate
adieu.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Under the discharge of artillery, and the fervent
benedictions of the vast assemblage who still lingered
and looked, when they no longer spoke, a last farewell,
the <em>Mount Vernon</em> proceeded on her way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On passing Alexandria, the wharves and shipping
were crowded with citizens and neighbors, all business
was suspended, and the ‘hum of men’ was hushed in
the respectful silence which pervaded this ‘parting
hour.’ The general, uncovered, took the station which
would place him nearest to his friends, where he could
best give and best receive the salute of mutual attachment
and esteem. So abstracted from ordinary considerations
were the minds of all parties, that the steersman
neared the town till the general became enveloped in the
smoke of the cannon, which, however appropriate to
enemies, were nearer than is usual to friends. The boat,
after passing, returned, and repassed the town, again and
again producing the most enthusiastic expressions of
affectionate farewell. The ramparts of Fort Washington
paid their honors, as the mansion, the groves, and
the tomb of Mount Vernon opened to view. The progress
of the little fleet was arrested, that the last of
the generals might pay his pious homage and filial duty
to the tomb of the paternal chief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette arose—the wonders which he had performed
for a man of his age, in successfully accomplishing
labors enough to have tested his meridian vigor,
whose animation rather resembles the spring than the
winter of life, now seemed unequal to the task he was
about to perform,—to take a last look at the grave of
Washington! He advanced to the effort: a silence the
most impressive reigned around, till the strains of sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>and plaintive music completed the grandeur and sacred
solemnity of the scene. All hearts beat in unison with
the throbbings of the veteran’s bosom, as he looked,
and that for the last time, on the sepulchre which contains
the ashes of the first of men. He spoke not, but
appeared absorbed in the mighty recollections which the
place and the occasion inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After this noble scene, the fleet resumed its course,
and, after a voyage of safety and expedition, anchored
near the <em>Brandywine</em> the ensuing morning. The general
was received in the commodore’s barge, and repaired,
through very inclement weather, to the gallant bark
which is to bear him to his other home. He was placed
on the deck of the ship by an ornamented chair, rigged
for the special purpose, and under a salute from the
main battery—the music of the band, and the greetings
of the commodore, his officers, and many guests, who
were assembled for this interesting event; but above
all, by the warm embrace of the Revolutionary worthies,
who had repaired to the ship to take another farewell of
their beloved associate of the heroic time. After a
sumptuous collation served in the captain’s cabin, and a
number of feeling and appropriate toasts, among which
was the following by La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The national flag of the United States; ever the
pledge of glory; on this day the rendezvous of friendship’;
and by Mr. Custis, of Arlington:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The <em>Brandywine</em>, which bears to his native land the
last of the generals of the army of American independence,
and the great apostle of the rights of mankind.—May
the winds of Heaven not visit her course too
roughly, but with kindest breath swell the bosom of her
sails, and the guardian genius that protects the just and
good, be an ever-watchful Palinurus to guide her helm.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>After which Colonel Bentalou, of Baltimore, offered the
following toast:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The memory of General Washington—the military
father and beloved friend of our nation’s guest.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“This toast was drunk standing, and the final moment
of separation having arrived, the last adieus were spoken.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The barges of the ship bore the sorrowing guests to
their respective vessels, while the thunders of the superb
<em>Brandywine</em> told to the echoes around the adieu to La
Fayette.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The day had been boisterous and rainy, but just as
the affecting scene had closed, the sun burst forth in all
his glory, as a propitious omen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The editor of the <em>Irishman</em>, a journal conducted at
Belfast, in the issue of September, 1825, in commenting
upon the proceedings at Washington on the occasion of
the farewell to La Fayette, says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We this day give our readers one of the most interesting
scenes which can be laid before the human mind,—the
departure and farewell address of the greatest
republic the world ever saw, to that veteran hero, whose
sword was one of the first in the field to assert her freedom.
The address of Mr. Adams is a chaste and beautiful
composition,—a triumphant recapitulation of the
glories of liberty,—and the reply of the old soldier is
characterized by all the fire of youth and wisdom of age.
The <em>Irishman</em> feels no small pleasure in being the
first journal to give these immortal productions to the
people of Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>North Star</cite>, printed at Danville, Vermont, says,
regarding La Fayette’s last act in America:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are informed that General La Fayette has addressed
a letter to General Fletcher, from on board the
<em>Brandywine</em>, on the subject of the imprisonment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>General William Barton, and inclosed a draft, with a
request that the sum for which General Barton was confined
should be paid. That request has been complied
with, and General Barton was informed that he was no
longer a prisoner. With what emotions of surprise and
gratitude this intelligence was received by the valiant
captor of Prescott can be better imagined than described.
The scene was rendered more interesting by the peculiarly
delicate manner in which the business was conducted
and the fact announced by General Fletcher.
All participated in the satisfaction which was expressed,
that General Barton was at liberty to return to his
family, after a separation of more than thirteen years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Kerate, a French author of a work entitled “Divine
Worship,” taking our reception of La Fayette as his standard,
addresses the French youth, and thus urges their
ambition to fly to the succor of the Greeks:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man is at this moment traversing the continent of
North America. The whole population crowds around
him; from the sources of the rivers, from the recesses of
the forests, they flock to see him; the maidens of the
banks of the Ohio crown him with flowers; the youths
desire to behold him, to touch his garments; the old
men to press his hand before they lose him. These
marks of respect will be transmitted from generation to
generation; they will become family documents. At
his approach the magistrates make room to receive him
among them; his presence diffuses joy in the cities; he
brings glory to the tombs of the brave; it might be
thought that they had waited for him to begin their
immortality; he himself is loaded with benedictions and
honors. What, then, has he done? Is he a prince or a
potentate? No! With the means at the command of a
private man he assisted an oppressed nation. Young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Frenchmen! this is the picture you should have before
your eyes; it is worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A letter from Paris, dated Sept. 7th, and published in
one of the London papers, says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our ministers are under a good deal of embarrassment
in regard to the manner of receiving La Fayette,
who, according to the accounts brought by the <em>Edward
Bonaffe</em>, must soon arrive. The moment our ministers
heard that the general was coming in the frigate <em>Brandywine</em>,
they despatched orders to the authorities at Havre,
to prevent any kind of meeting and every mark of
honor which might be attempted to be bestowed upon
him. On the other hand, the most respectable of the
merchants and other inhabitants have resolved to express
their esteem for his character by every means in
their power. The military commandant is a violent
royalist, but the mayor is a good-natured, moderate man,
who wishes to avoid every sort of tyrannical measures.
The American frigate is another subject of embarrassment.
It is usual, when a frigate enters the port, for
her to salute the batteries with fifteen guns, but this
salute must be returned by an equal number. Now, our
government are afraid that, if they reply to the American
salute, the people will think they are expending
powder in honor of La Fayette; but if they do not agree
to return, they will be obliged to let the frigate enter
without saluting, for they well know that the American
captain will not burn a match without an assurance of
reciprocity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The editor of the <cite>Niles Register</cite> adds:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The writer of the letter justly estimates the fact.
Morris and his crew would rather fight the largest and
the best-fitted frigate that ever belonged to France, than
fire a salute but with the belief that it would be returned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>gun for gun. The stripes and stars may be hauled down
by a conqueror, but shall not be disgraced.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>Niles Register</cite> for November says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette was received at Havre with the greatest
enthusiasm. It does not appear that the government
had taken any measures to prevent a favorable greeting
of him. The <em>Brandywine</em> saluted the forts, which returned
an equal number of guns. On the day of his
disembarkation, the general proceeded to his country-seat,
accompanied for two leagues by a numerous cavalcade,
consisting of young men of the principal families of
Havre and its neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When General La Fayette was about to leave the
frigate <em>Brandywine</em>, on her arrival at Havre, a farewell
address was presented to him by the midshipmen attached
to the ship. To this flattering attention General
La Fayette thus verbally replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear young Friends</span>: I am unable to express my
feelings towards you. Before I had the pleasure of your
acquaintance I considered it an honor to belong to the
United States navy: since then my knowledge of you
as individuals has added to my admiration of the chivalry
of your profession, and rendered sanguine my expectations
of its future achievements. Your country
has reason to be proud of you; I part from you with
regret: but should your duties or inclinations bring you
again to France, remember that La Grange is the home
of every American. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Paris <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Constitutionnel</cite></span> of the 20th December, 1825,
contained a circumstantial account of the reception of
La Fayette at La Grange, after his return from his
visit to America. The neighboring villages united in a
public festival in his honor, notwithstanding strong efforts
on the part of the municipal authorities to prevent
rejoicing of any kind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>The following is a translation of one of the addresses
delivered to the general by deputations, together with
one of his answers.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Address</em>: “At length we again behold you, grown
younger from the atmosphere of liberty which you
have been breathing, and the spectacle of the happiness
of a powerful and grateful people, which you have
contemplated with delight. Like the Americans, we
could wish to describe to you our love, pleasure, and
admiration; but these sentiments, agitating too strongly
our hearts, deprive us of the power of so doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To which the general replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The affecting welcome which awaited me here, and
the fresh testimonials of attachment which you lavish
upon me to-day, fill up the measure of my joy in finding
myself in the bosom of my family and in the midst of
you, my dear friends and neighbors. During my journeys
over the free and prosperous territories of the
United States it was sweet to me to think that the
voices of that excellent and admirable people would
resound even as far as your abodes, and that you would
enjoy them for me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The enemies of the people’s cause have cast it as a
reproach upon me that, in expressing my sentiments at
the American meetings, I thought also of you. They
were right to believe this; and, in fact, at the sight of
the wonders of the public prosperity and private happiness
which, in that immense country, are the fruits of
liberty, equality, legal and national order, it would have
been difficult for me to forget the wish I had ever cherished,
that my French countrymen should exercise the
same rights and obtain the same felicity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see me now restored to my retreat of La
Grange, which is dear to me on so many accounts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>and to those agricultural employments of which you
know me to be so fond, and which, for a long series of
years, I shared with you, my neighbors, and the greater
part of the friends who surround me. Your regard,
fully reciprocated on my part, causes them to be more
and more prized. Accept, I pray you, my thanks for
the fine festival that you have prepared for me, and that
fills my heart with delight and gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>More than six thousand persons were present at this
joyous commemoration of the return of him whom they
called the <em>American Nation’s Guest</em>. The dancing was
continued throughout the night, and the air was filled
with cries of “Long live La Fayette!” “Long live
the friend of the people!” On the following day the
general received a number of distinguished visitors from
Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Edinburgh <cite>Observer</cite> thus comments upon this
memorable visit of La Fayette to America:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“After a residence of nearly twelve months in the
United States, General La Fayette has at last returned
to Europe. Hitherto we have, somehow, abstained from
saying a single word on the extraordinary spectacles by
which his visit has been throughout distinguished. We
have, like all mankind, been struck mute, as it were, by
each successive gushing out of the spontaneous and unpurchased
homage of ten millions of free people. We
have stood by, in almost stupid wonder, while so many
more than classic triumphs, so much higher than classic
feelings, were performing and bursting around us, hardly
knowing, indeed, whether we had to deal with the honest
excitement of a real and gallant people, or were cheated
by the solemn phantasies of a race of Bedlamites. It
was not, in fact, till after the blinding pageant had passed
away that we could bring ourselves to talk soberly either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>of its fitness or its reality. At last, however, the question
does rush upon our minds: Why have all these
things been? How is it that for twelve long months we
have heard of nothing but processions, feastings, and
jubilees, among a people pre-eminent among all men for
thrift, jealousy, and stubbornness? What can this or
any man have done, to turn upon himself the rejoicing
lustre of so many millions of eyes, to call down blessings
from so incalculable a host of uplifted hands, and to feel
the honors and gratitude of a mighty people wafted to
his bosom as by the voice of a single man? What is it,
in fact, that has swayed the hearts of these stout republicans
throughout the twenty-four communities, that has
hurried, all along that vast line, every woman from her
distaff, and every infant from its cradle, to shout, on the
steps of a total stranger to their blood, and has now
melted so many jarring interests into one general prayer
of regret, thankfulness, and safety? This is not anything
like a venal sycophancy to dignity or riches or
descent; it is not the conventual homage of one great
authority to another, nor can it be placed even among
the reasonable but frigid trophies of a mere general
merit. It is too stupendous, too immediate, too much
akin to the burning ardor of children to a parent. It is
a portion of the unbounded gratitude of a gallant people
to the <em>founder of their freedom</em>. It is no mere temporary
return of any present benefit, but a part of the perpetual
worship owing to an author of their political existence.
It is the homage of America to the Nestor of the Revolution.
Her early warriors are now no more. Her Franklins
and Washingtons have long since sunk, one after
another, amid the tears of their people, into an illustrious
tomb. One commander alone remains who fought at
Flat-Bush, at Brandywine, and at Yorktown. What wonder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>then, that the honors, and almost the merits, of the
extinguished mighty should seem to concentrate around
their sole surviving fellow? Generation after generation
has sundered him from everything in America that
could excite rivalry and add a sting to passion. He
left them in a feverish and bloody infancy; he has returned
in their peaceful and majestic manhood. He left
them worn, divided, and impoverished; he has found
them strong, unanimous, and rich. He has come to see
the grain quietly waving over the fields of slaughter; to
find their once vacant harbors crowded with a gallant
navy; their unsheltered beaches secured by impregnable
works; their swampy forests swarming with a gay and
growing population. And he can say, what no living
leader can say with him, ‘This is partly my work; in the
heart of a corrupted state I digested the manual of freedom;
hemmed round by the blandishments of luxury, I
preserved the spirit of independence; I forsook the court
for the sword; I adopted danger for ease; and here are
my rewards!’ It was the younger Scaliger, we believe,
who would have preferred the honor of writing a single
ode of Horace, to the empire of Germany, and he was
right. But what are the honors of all the odes of all the
Horaces that ever lived, to this pride of a patriot’s bosom,
to the outbursting of a nation’s gratitude? After all,
there is much more in these things than the merit or the
praise of any one person, or any one set of persons. It
is not man individually, but man collectively, that is here
chiefly concerned. These rewards and these deservings
are, in fact, the recognition by Nature of her own nobility.
They form the evidence which she bears to the eternity
of her own character; they are the proud effusions of
her thankfulness to the power which impressed that
character upon her.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>THE death of Louis XVIII. placed Charles X. on
the throne of France, But nothing was to be hoped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>from him. He was a more tenacious upholder of the old
tyrannical régime than his brother; indeed, he himself
declared, “La Fayette and I are the only two men in
France who have remained perfectly firm in their principles
through the Revolution.” That was probably
true; but <em>his</em> principles were far removed from those of
the liberty-loving La Fayette.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was again elected to the Assembly in 1827,
and his declarations were as fearless, and his liberal
measures as unpopular with the government as ever.
As an illustration of La Fayette’s views upon public
affairs at that time, we quote the following speech of the
marquis, on the subject of the final disposition of the
budget of 1826, pronounced at the sitting of the Chamber
of Deputies, of the 23d of June, 1828.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: When in compliance with the rules
of this house, I announced my intention of addressing
you on the concerns of a preceding year, I had not heard
the reading of the report of your committee, which I
consider a true model of that kind of labor; but such is
my conviction that the state of public accounts for former
years affords useful data to the discussion of a future
budget, I will indulge a few remarks in addition to what
has already been said on the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg leave in the first place to call your attention to
the state of our social organization, for I am undoubtedly
one of those who cannot forget that, by the revolution
of ’89, a long series of oppressions, arising not only
out of hereditary, sacerdotal, and judiciary privileges
and institutions, but also from the prostitution of our
commercial, agricultural, and domestic interests, have
been erased from the codes of France. The seeds of
improvement and public welfare, disseminated through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>almost every class of our countrymen, notwithstanding
the baneful influence of persecutions, miseries, and despotisms,
have at last been brought to maturity. The
return of peace cannot fail to have promoted their
development, and the enjoyment of public liberty promises
successful and abundant harvest. But whilst nations
advance, governments retrograde; and let us consider,
gentlemen, what is our present situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A redundant luxuriance of ministerial bounties, resting
upon factitious administrations, which themselves
are founded upon nothing; a multitude of offices created
for the sake of emolument, and emoluments for the sake
of patronage; every section of France sacrificed to a
system of concentration, of which our metropolis, prosperous
in so many other respects, presents those deplorable
contrasts which our honorable colleague, Mr. Charles
Dupin, has lately introduced to your notice; the precious
lights of academies, of public lectures and learned
schools, above all, of the polytechnic school, dazzling the
eyes of a population, who, as some have just observed,
are still denied the means of learning the first elements
of reading, and in the midst of whom it is yet made a
question whether it is proper that the people should be
able to read; in a word, an unexampled host of generals,
staff officers, privileged bodies, foreign corps, but few
soldiers and a nation, formerly one entire army, who for
a long time conquered all Europe combined against her
independence, but now disorganized and disarmed, as if
a conquered people: with this state of things, can it be
believed, gentlemen, that a few trifling amendments of
committees, and some oratorical criticisms, will be adequate
to the thorough reform of a social existence that
might be called the inverse ratio of constitutional order!</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no bitterness in my observations, gentlemen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>they are dictated by the conscience of a simple
individual, and in the interest of those who, in undertaking
to manage the affairs of a mighty nation, should
at least use their endeavor to persuade the people that
if they themselves had the power of managing their own
concerns, they would not exercise it to greater advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The public debt, enormously increased for the last
fifteen years, the civil list, the crown revenue, the pensions
of the royal family, are not within the limits of
our control. Every debt is sacred, but some are yet in
suspense. For example, whilst all the European powers
were largely indemnified according to their pretensions
(English claims even to three times the amount allowed
to French creditors), had the United States shown some
hostile feelings towards us, or had they merely asserted
their claims in concert with the other powers, their
demands would have been immediately liquidated. But
they have never yet been adjusted, because that nation
would not join the enemies of France, who were then to
be found in her bosom, notwithstanding what has sometimes
been said at this tribune to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With regard to the civil list, gentlemen, it might
perhaps be desirable, both for its proper management
and the personal comfort of the king, that the appropriations
not included within the king’s personal expenses
should have been granted under the forms of accountability
adopted in the civil list of England.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The appropriation for the criminal judiciary department
furnishes me another opportunity of again proffering
my warmest wishes for the abolition of capital
punishment, which the uncertainty of human comprehension
renders so alarming, and which must particularly
appall those generations who have so irretrievably suffered
from the furies of parties; and also for the abolishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>of branding, called for on all sides. May the
minister at the head of the judiciary department affix
his name to these two salutary measures!</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of my honorable friends has adverted to the
gratuitous magistracy of English justices of the peace.
I do not envy this pretended benefit of our neighbors,
and it is my opinion that those great proprietors are not
the most proper persons to exercise a sovereign jurisdiction
over all the petty offences committed within their
department; but I cheerfully concur in the unanimous
voice for restoring the principle of temporary election in
justices of the peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing can be more gratifying to my feelings than
to have heard, on the last discussion on trials by jury,
the pledge that the propriety of extending the benefit of
this institution to the transgressions of the press will
be taken into consideration at the next session.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot withhold my assent to the observations of
the report on the whole of ministerial budgets. I had
myself said at this tribune in 1819, ‘It would be highly
beneficial that every ministry should inquire, with all
conscientious severity, into what is necessary to the due
performance of their duties, and should propose in all
remaining details, terms as generous and complete as
they please, for the security and comforts of those actually
in office, provided that ministers should be divested
of all parasitical service, and children brought up to a
more profitable labor than the industry of obtaining situations,
which is so detrimental to every kind of industry,
and to the independence of a vast number of citizens.’
The specification,—I mean the application,—which can
never be too minute, of every appropriation to every
item of expenditure, has already made some progress;
but how profuse those specifications, beyond which there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>is ministerial exertion, when compared with English
budgets, of which I now hold in my hand three departments,—the
artillery, war, and navy; and yet this is not
<em>a cheap government</em>, to use an expression that has so
often been charged upon me, and which I am so unwilling
to deny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The minister for foreign affairs has opened his
career under the most critical circumstances; his official
duties will be dictated by the loyalty of his personal
character. The great political question is now, to decide
whether this government will continue to follow the
track of old diplomatic traditions, or whether, divested
of all foreign influence and reminiscence, it will boldly
assume the rank it behooves us to take at the head of
European civilization; a post which, in my opinion, has
always remained vacant, notwithstanding appearances
contradicted by facts; a stand to which no foreign power
any longer dares lay any claim. From that exalted station,
France may and ought to resist coalitions in which
none of her interests are involved. For my own part, I
should have expected more satisfactory explanations and
details before giving my assent to the late loan of eighty
millions, but none would more readily consent to the
measures necessary for the liberty and independence of
Greece; to enable her by assistance to defend herself;
to erect a barrier against the ambition of other powers;
to abolish the ignominious sale of fellow-beings, and
rescue from slavery all those wretched victims of whom
our interference has hitherto been inadequate to their
deliverance; and in this I should foresee the advantage
of our commercial relations, which, in spite of narrow
prejudices, will always find a benefit in extending to
other people the blessings and comforts of education and
liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>“France, so long accustomed to triumph over the
most formidable coalitions, wonders at finding herself
encumbered under petty man&oelig;uvres, the mysteries of
which she cannot unravel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will not mention our unfortunate and criminal expedition
into Spain, nor the cruel lessons given to despotism,
oppression, and aristocracy in the peninsula, the
various and beautiful provinces of which are, I hope,
destined to a better fate. But I must beg leave to call
your attention to our enormous and foolish error with
regard to the new American states.... What blindness,
gentlemen, what complacency, can induce us obstinately
to withhold our assent to the recognition of the
South American republics, in return for insult, ingratitude,
and bankruptcy? The British government itself,
it is true, although under the direction of an illustrious
minister, hesitated a while before adopting that step; but
it no sooner saw the immense advantages accruing to the
United States, from the priority of that recognition, and
a timely official declaration of protection and sympathy,
than it hastened to associate itself in the honor and
profit of their new relations. After long expectations,
gentlemen, France is still reduced to those half-way
measures that create mistrust and discontent, whilst it
is a well-known fact that French productions and manufactures
find a better market in that extensive territory
than those of all other nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whilst the freedom of worship is guaranteed by the
charter, and its equality sanctioned by our new morals
and habits, it is unnecessary to remark that, even under
the ancient régime, Catholic affairs never formed a special
branch of the ministry. Amidst the attacks of the
pretended supporters of the altar, I will also deprecate
that cold fanaticism which endeavors to represent Christianity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>an institution originally founded on social equality,
as hostile to the rights and opinions of the people
thus calling, as it were, for a sort of retaliating animadversion
against opinions and practices that are totally
distinct from worldly ambition. I will seek for the solution
of that inextricable dilemma of the duty of the
priest, considered both as speaking in the name of Heaven,
and as a pay officer of state; but where shall I find it
but in that country where religious freedom is more
generally prevalent than in France, where the ministers
of religion are more respected, and sectarians live in
peace; in that government where no rights and regulations
can give umbrage, but where, being altogether
foreign to and distinct from all civil institutions and
form of government, religious societies are formed without
restraint and choose their own ministers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The separation of the ecclesiastical department from
the ministry of public instruction, I consider as much an
act of piety as of sound judgment. But too much has
yet been left to the infringements of the Catholic clergy.
It is not only a religion of the state, but also a very prevailing
one still to be found in those ordinances which
ought to have secluded its special dogmas within the
walls of the church, and confined its distinction of creeds
to the circle of private families.</p>

<p class='c010'>“National instruction, gentlemen, and especially elementary
education, that main-spring of public reason, of
practical morality, of public peace and comfort, is at
present the first want of the French population, as it is
the first duty of government. You all know, gentlemen,
how this duty is to be discharged. Methods of instruction
have heretofore been protected in an inverse
ratio to their being perfect and easy. Neither your
paltry vote of 50,000 francs, nor 500,000 francs, can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>adequate to the redemption of that most important of
all social obligations. Under a competent and legal system
of public instruction, I would consider five millions
as the most desirable appropriation of a budget.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Many statesmen appear to have forgotten,—some perhaps
have never been aware,—that by the law of the 3d
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Brumaire</em></span>, year IV., France was provided with the best
system of instruction that ever existed in any country.
It could not be consistent with that power which severed
from the institute the class of moral and political
sciences. Napoleon created the university, the monopoly
and exigencies of which wounded the feelings of private
families and displeased the true friends of liberty,
but which was afterwards indebted to the invasion of
Jesuitism, a privilege of another kind, for the credit of
being looked upon as a liberal institution. In order to
satisfy all parties it would be necessary, at the next session,
to offer a plan for the organization of public instruction,
wherein all the national duties of teaching
should be strictly laid down, and all individual liberties
respected; but every plan of education, particularly in
its elementary bearings, would require the co-operation
of true civil administrations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why is it, gentlemen, that in utter contempt of the
most solemn pledges, we have preserved for fourteen
years the whole imperial structure of the internal administration
in France? those factitious municipalities,
those unsettled councils, those despotic and turbulent
prefectures and sub-prefectures, which have never been
amended except for successively adding to their inconveniences,
attributions, and appointments? When shall
we see every section manage its own <a id='corr373.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='concerns'>concerns,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_373.32'><ins class='correction' title='concerns'>concerns,</ins></a></span> provide
for all its own exigencies, and retain within its territory
that portion of the taxes that we are afterwards compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>to send back to it? Is this idea unknown in
France? But the constituent assembly, whatever has
been said to the contrary at this tribune, had not
only proclaimed useful and true doctrines; it had also
organized a system of administration elected by the
citizens, and was abolished only by the consulate and by
the empire. Is it replete with such great difficulties?
But when in 1815, Napoleon, in a fit of liberalism, restored
the municipalities in accordance with the law of
’91, elections were made with remarkable celerity and
moderation. The only embarrassment that could arise
would be in the government, if instead of abiding by the
dictates of eternal truth and of contemporary reason, it
found it necessary to combine principle with exception,
right with privilege, thereby perplexing and deluding
the purest intentions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will follow the report of the committee in the examination
of the war department, merely with the view
to support the proposition of placing in the civil list the
payment of the king’s military household. You have also
heard on this subject the excellent discourse, to which my
honorable friend, General Gerard, has given all the weight
of his experience and of his glory. The minister of war,
in offering observations that will be made the subject of
future deliberations, has just expressed his desire of completing
our system of defence. Here, gentlemen, we naturally
bring back to our memory the urgent call recently
made by the ministry upon our patriotism to obtain the
means necessary to a preserving policy, a respectable military
strength, a guarantee of public tranquillity, a national
dignity; and to an union of the people with the government.
The minister had before represented the nation
rising in a body at the voice of their king. I will not
attempt, gentlemen, the solution of the problem; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>knot has been untied by a celebrated writer whose authority
is daily referred to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The stationary National Guard, says an ordinance
of the king, dated March, 1815, comprising a mass of
three millions of landed and industrious proprietors, constitutes
a local force extended on every point....</p>

<p class='c010'>“From this formidable mass, whose dearest interests
attach them to the soil, may be formed voluntary corps
constituting movable columns....</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thus the nation, fighting on every point with the
army, either in the line or as auxiliaries, will prove that
a great people cannot unwillingly be brought under the
yoke that they have once shaken off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen, I will only remind the government that
eight years ago, in the session of 1820, the ministers then
acknowledged that they had been in possession, for eight
months, of the project of a law drawn up by a special
commission, and you all know how it has hitherto resulted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The glory of the French navy has resounded in every
heart. The name of Navarino has been proclaimed with
an unanimous concert by the throne and in the chamber,
as it had been echoed by the whole nation; the brave
Admiral de Rigny is perfectly secure against the censure
of a recall. The infamous traffic of human flesh has been
partly suppressed, but it is not yet totally extinct. With
an entire confidence in the sentiments of the minister of
marine on these important questions, I submit to his
wisdom the idea of placing the slave trade on the same
footing as piracy, as the law of the United States has
given the example, since followed by England. With
regard to the management of our colonies, gentlemen,
there is so much to say that I could not briefly enter on
the subject. I will merely remark that the system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>colonization of the ancients is, in any opinion, much
preferable to that of modern times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the law under consideration the minister of finance
has undoubtedly surpassed all his colleagues; but when
a thorough discussion is about taking place, I do not feel
sufficient confidence to anticipate the opinions that you
will hear from colleagues more learned and more skilful
than myself. I should even consider myself worthy of
reproach, had I not made it a duty to offer some of my
ideas, but especially to call at this tribune for more effectual
social reforms than can possibly be achieved by way
of amendments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was constantly the recipient of attention
and distinguished honors, both in America and in France.
The young men of Auvergne gave him a splendid banquet
on the 23d of June, 1828. The old general’s toast
was: “To the assembled young men of the three departments
of Auvergne, and to our dear mountains; the
volcanoes of these are extinct, but the sacred fire of
liberty will never be extinguished among them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The marquis never forgot any of his friends, especially
his American comrades, and his affection for the fathers
was continued to the sons, as the subjoined letter to
Charles A. Clinton, written to him by La Fayette upon
receiving the news of the death of his father, De Witt
Clinton, will demonstrate.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Paris</span>, March 30, 1828.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>: Your personal and friendly attentions
to me make you a natural organ of the melancholy

<p class='c030'>At the celebration of the commencement of the Ohio
and Baltimore Railroad, which occurred on the 4th of
July, 1828, a pair of handsome morocco slippers, and a
pair of beautiful white satin shoes were made by the
cordwainers during the procession. The morocco slippers
were presented to the venerable Carroll, on the
ground; and the white satin shoes were subsequently
transmitted to General La Fayette, together with the
badges worn by the association. This compliment received
the following reply:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: With affectionate feelings of pleasure, I
have received your kind letter, the badge bearing a likeness
of our matchless Washington, and of my excellent friend,
the surviving signer of independence, the ensigns of your
association as they were worn by your worthy president,
and an elegant pair of ladies’ white satin slippers, which
were manufactured in the procession. For those gratifying
marks of your remembrance and friendship, I beg
you to accept my most grateful thanks. The anniversary
of American independence, the commencement of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, have been happy associations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>So I have seen, as it were, the commencement
of your city in the first years of the Revolutionary struggle,
of which this very day is one of the (1777) anniversaries,
that of the battle of Brandywine; and it has been
lately to me a matter of proud delight to witness the immense
progress of Baltimore, a great and rapid increase
of which we may now more than ever anticipate. Its
happy effects upon every sort of trade and industry cannot
be doubted, and I offer you the cordial congratulation

received your kind letter, and a copy of the apron and
badge which on the late celebration, doubly dear to an
American heart, were worn by the book-binders of Baltimore.
Testimonies of your remembrance and affection are
at all times highly gratifying to me, nor could they prove
more welcome than on this momentous occasion, when
the anniversary day of independence is hailed in common
with the commencement of one of its most promising
results, amidst the immense progress of every kind
that has taken place since it has first been my happy lot
to be admitted as a soldier of the United States, and particularly
as a citizen of Maryland. I am proud to have
been enabled to show specimens of American book-binding
which every day excite European admiration. I beg
you, gentlemen, to accept the respectful acknowledgments
and affectionate good wishes of a veteran who
would have been happy, in the procession, to have followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>his venerable friend, the surviving signer of the

<p class='c030'>“After other business during the second session of
the twentieth Congress the Vice-President communicated
a letter from the President of the United States, transmitting
one received from Monsieur David, the artist,
member of the Institute of France, professor of the
School of Painting at Paris, and member of the Legion
of Honor, who presents to Congress the bust of General
La Fayette, which has been received with it.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The following is a translated copy of the letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Paris</span>, Sept. 11, 1828.</div>

<p class='c030'>“<span class='sc'>To the President</span>: I have made a bust of La
Fayette, and would willingly raise a statue to his honor—not
for himself, because he has no need of it, but for
ourselves, who approve in so lively a manner the desire
of expressing to him the affectionate regard and admiration
with which we are inspired. The youth of the
French nation is filled with admiration for the virtues
of the youth and the old age of him whose likeness I
send you.</p>

<p class='c030'>“They envy the glory that was acquired upon the
American soil, by the side of the immortal Washington,
and the defence of your noble rights.</p>

<p class='c030'>“They envy that glory which has been acquired on
the soil of France, in the midst of the troubles of Paris
and of Versailles, where, in breasting the storm, he
wanted courage as little in the struggles of debate as
he did in contending with the sword. They envy the
glory which covers the brow whitened by age, but still
sparkling with the fire of liberty and of patriotism.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>“It is in the name of this youthful feeling of the
French nation, ambitious to imitate everything generous
and great, that I offer you a work upon which my hands
have been employed for some time and with great care.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I could wish that it was more worthy of the subject—more
worthy of the place which I am desirous to see
it occupy. Yes, sir, I could wish that the bust of our
brave general, of our illustrious deputy, should be elevated
on a pedestal in the audience chamber of Congress,
near the monument erected to Washington himself; that
the son be placed by the side of the father, or, if you
please, that the two brothers in arms, the two companions
in victory, the friends of order and of law, may be
no more separated in our estimation than they were in
their devotion to the cause of liberty and in the hour of
peril.</p>

<p class='c030'>“La Fayette is one of the ties that unite the two
worlds. He visited the new one to remain there for a
few months, and to salute once more your sacred land of
justice and equality, and has returned to us after having
partaken of your feasts and received the honor and the
benediction of your nation.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I hasten to render my homage in return—I present
you with his image. It will be a memento that the
original may often recall to the National Assembly those
eternal principles upon which the independence of the

safety.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>The following is a description of the bust as given in
the <cite>National Intelligencer</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“The bust is of a fine white marble, and is the work of
P. J. David, of D’Angers, in France.</p>

<p class='c030'>“It is of a size larger than the life, and exhibits a fine
likeness of that distinguished apostle of liberty. On the
front is ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Au général La Fayette</em></span>,’ and the name and residence
of the artist, with the year (1828) of its execution.
On the left side is an inscription, indented in the stone,
in the following words: ‘La Fayette’s speech in the
House of Representatives, Dec. 10, 1824.—What better
pledge can be given of a persevering national love of
liberty, when these blessings are evidently the results
of a virtuous resistance of oppression, and institutions
founded on the rights of man, and the republican opinion
of self-government?’</p>

<p class='c030'>“On the right side is the following:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘La Fayette’s last words in his answer to the President’s
farewell speech, Washington, Sept. 7, 1825: God
bless you, sir, and all who surround us. God bless the
American people, and each of their states, and the federal
government. Accept this patriotic farewell of an
overflowing heart; and such will be its last throb when
it ceases to beat.’”</p>

<p class='c030'>The <cite>New York American</cite> of December, 1828, says:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“A letter from General La Fayette, of December 29,
from Lagrange, tells us—and as he belongs to the
nation, we may repeat—that Madame Perier (the eldest
daughter of Mr. George La Fayette) has just made him
a <em>great-grandfather</em>. The same letter says, ‘I expect to
be in town in a few days, and enjoy the agreeable American
society which has convened there from the several
parts of the Union. It will be something like a Washington
winter.’”</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>The following is the substance of General La Fayette’s
address at the Fourth of July dinner in Paris, in
1829:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“The health of their venerable guest, General La Fayette,
having been given, the general in returning thanks,
stated the pleasure which he felt in celebrating this
anniversary, which enabled him, as it were, again to
breathe the American atmosphere. He spoke with high
gratification of their associating him with the principles
for which he had struggled under the illustrious and
well-beloved Washington. The independence of the
United States began a new era of political civilization,
which will finally extend over the whole world, and
which is founded on the natural rights of mankind.
He was proud to own that the first declaration of those
rights bore the indelible imprint of its American origin.
He referred in eloquent terms to the delight with which
all generous minds had hailed the recent triumph in
Great Britain over religious intolerance, and earnestly
advised the Americans in consolidating their constitution
not to listen to European suggestions, nor admit any
exotic materials. He concluded by giving a toast to
‘National Legitimacy,’ which, while it choked and destroyed
the weeds of privilege, nourished the roots of
natural and solid right.”</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1829 General La Fayette came into possession of a
large property under the indemnity law, being the fortune
of his own and his wife’s family, of which the Revolution
had deprived them.</p>

<p class='c030'>We will quote from one more speech of La Fayette, in
the French Chamber of Deputies, on the 9th of July,
1829. The question under discussion was the accordance
of an eventual credit of fifty-two millions of francs.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Gentlemen,” said La Fayette, “though I have voted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>against approving the budget of expenses, in the hope
that its refusal would prove a prompt and efficacious
means of obtaining those institutions and economies
which France has for so long a time expected, yet I
feel disposed to vote in favor of the credits demanded,
provided the chamber receives those explanations which
it stands so much in need of. I do not see in the great
quarrel of the east, as regards ourselves, anything beyond
our importance as an intermediate power in what
is called the balance of Europe; only two classes,
the oppressors and the oppressed; in the demarkation of
states, nothing but their natural limits; in the well-being
of a people, nothing but the advantage of all; and in
the policy of France, nothing but a liberal and independent
part to act. You know, gentlemen, that great and
powerful alliance which would enslave and brutalize the
human family. It covers the peninsula with blood, oppresses
Italy, and throws other states into disorder.
Vienna is its metropolis, and in spite of other pretensions,
Don Miguel is its ideal type.</p>

<p class='c030'>“England has pretended to favor the world with
another beacon, whose light is sometimes extinguished,
and at other times shines but to decoy; upon this point
inquire of Italy, of Spain, and of Portugal. It is for
France then, gentlemen, which finds herself more in
accord with our ideas of the new civilization, to place
herself at the head of that civilization; in that consists
her glory and her interest; there, too, in case of need,
will be found her ambition; and there, also, the dignity
and the safety of her government. But to perform that
noble task it is necessary that the government resolve
no longer to fear either a representative or an armed
nation, and that abandoning its former relations, it may
be able to say to foreign powers, ‘Next to God, it is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the people of France that I am indebted for being elevated
above your influence and beyond your pretensions.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“I will confine myself, gentlemen, to a few remarks
on the grounds to which our attention has been invited
by the application made for the credits now under consideration.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Some of my honorable friends have spoken harshly
of the expedition to the Morea; they have even thought
that it was in no degree whatever entitled to public
approbation; but I have so ardently desired some kind
of interference, particularly French interposition, in behalf
of Greece, that I cannot join them in their criticisms,
and as to our portion of that generosity which
was manifested in the relief afforded, without speaking
of Russia, whose motives are obvious, it would be sufficient
to advert to two discourses from the throne, in one
of which the battle of Navarino is called by Charles X.
<em>glorious</em>, while from George IV. it received the appellation
of <em>untoward</em>, to prevent us from confounding the
shades of the two interests in the cause of Greece, and
to mark the distinction between the cannonading at
Terceira and the hospitality at Brest. The last protocol,
however, from London has humbled my pride and diminished
my expectations.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Why, gentlemen, have the Greeks taken up arms?
why have they endured so many calamities? why have
they so freely shed their blood? It was to free themselves
from paying tribute to the Turks; to build up
again their ancient country; and to enjoy in their own
way the blessings of self-government. But now, gentlemen,
the protocol brings into fresh existence the odious
tribute; the greatest part of Greece is shut out from
Greece, and to govern the small portion which remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>it is proposed to look, I know not where, or for whom,
but for some foreign prince, a hospodar, a mongrel of
the East and of the West, in whom the Greeks will only
behold a vassal of the Porte, and for whom they must
pay an additional tribute.</p>

<p class='c030'>“All this, gentlemen, may be very agreeable to Russia,
which dreams already of new subjects there; and to England,
which has always feared that in that country she
would find rivals in the coasting trade; but not to
France, whose interest it is to have there a friendly and
powerful nation, a barrier against the conquering and
commercial ambition of other powers. Upon that topic
it is that we look for explanations. The government of
Italy is enslaved by the influence of Austria. Italy, were
she free, would be our friend. Spain, whose methods of
justice consist in strangling by turns the patriots and
the Carlists, will never, in truth, be our ally until she
again becomes constitutional.</p>

<p class='c030'>“As to Portugal, it is in vain that the English government
has lately sought to balance the mock sovereignty
of the cortés of Miguel against those institutions which
the British ambassador, let it be said, by the by, had
imported for it from Brazil.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Gentlemen, the partisans of national laws cannot
accept this concession; there is no legitimacy there
where nothing can be found but a despotic violation of
all rights, social as well as natural. Besides, we do not
know in what manner these pretended cortés have been
formed, and how the deputies, who were not of Miguel’s
choice, were rejected. Let us hope, gentlemen, that public
indignation, and the stupid attacks which have been
lately made on the flags of other nations, will soon put
an end to this infamous usurpation, and that in the mean
time France will ever protest against the horrid expedient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>which would deliver up a young and innocent victim
to the brutality of Don Miguel. I will not deny,
gentlemen, that there have been troubles in South America
and in Mexico, and that perhaps they yet exist there.
Their troubles, however, have been exaggerated. I attribute
them principally to two causes: to the threats,
the impotent threats, of Spain, which lead to the permanence
of disproportioned armies and the agitation of
their leaders; the other cause is to be found in European
intriguers, who persevere in obstinately attempting to
introduce their old institutions into these new states.
Put a period to the two causes, and the tranquillity of
commerce will be immediately restored.</p>

<p class='c030'>“The minister of commerce observed a few days since
that there was nothing in common between diplomatic
relations and commercial interests in these countries. I
have, however, in my possession a <cite>Mexican Gazette</cite>, containing
a decree by which the productions of states that
shall not have recognized the republic in the course of
the present year shall be subjected to an additional duty,
whilst those which shall send, during the year 1829, diplomatic
agents to that country, shall be treated more
favorably. It is time, gentlemen, that the government
should at length yield to the commercial views of France.</p>

<p class='c030'>“As regards Algiers, I will leave that question to one
of my honorable friends, who is better acquainted with
it than myself; but I cannot forbear referring to a more
serious attack on the national honor than that of the dey
of Algiers throwing his fan. I allude to what has passed
lately relative to the expulsion of Galloti. The delivering
up of an alien for political causes has been unanimously
reprobated in every age and by every country.
Eminent jurisconsults have assured me that the laws of
our country have been violated by the expulsion of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>individual. I am willing, however, to admit that there
has been, on the part of French agents, error and precipitancy,
and consequently, as I doubt not, repentance.
There has, however, been deception somewhere, and violence
has been offered to the honor of France. Highway
robbery and judgments in this case have been referred
to; but are you ignorant of what judgments are, or of
what they may be under absolute governments?</p>

<p class='c030'>“Suppose, for example, Don Miguel were to say:
‘Behold the man who has in the palace of the king assassinated,
with his own hand, the Marquis of Loulé, the
best friend of my father! Give him up to me that I
may punish him for the crime.’ Would the accusation
be believed?</p>

<p class='c030'>“In a word, gentlemen, the honor of France has been
outraged; justice must be done; Galloti must be demanded;
the demand must be enforced; he must be
restored to the soil of France, and the national honor
must in some way receive signal reparation.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I will conclude, gentlemen, by observing that the
explanations which the discussions may produce shall
decide my vote.”</p>

<p class='c030'>At a sitting of the Chamber of Deputies General La
Fayette made the following remarks on the “Holy Alliance”:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“There was a vast and powerful league which desired
to command and brutalize the human species. It has
oppressed Italy, devastated the peninsula, and had disturbed
other states. Its chief seat is Vienna, and Don
Miguel its ideal type. England has pretended to set up
another system, but it was only to lure states to their
ruin. It was the business of France to place herself at
the head of civilization—her glory, her interest, and her
ambition to require it; but to fulfil this noble destiny it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>was necessary that the government should determine not
to fear either a nation represented or a nation armed,
and, renouncing all connections, it should say to foreign
powers, ‘After God, it is to the French people that I am
indebted for being placed above your influence and beyond
your pretensions.’”</p>

<p class='c030'>During 1829 General La Fayette made a tour through
some of the French provinces, and his reception by the
people appears to have rivalled the enthusiasm displayed
in his honor in the United States. One London
paper says:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“Never was a king so feasted and treated as this venerable
remnant of the Revolution has been. In every
quarter he has been received with shouts of triumph and
congratulatory addresses, which, while they have been
complimentary to him, have generally, also, been made
the vehicle for strong philippics against the new order of
things. From Grenoble to Lyons the road was thronged
by continual crowds of people who came to testify their
regard for the principles which had guided his political
conduct, and the esteem which they entertained towards
himself personally.”
g
The <cite>Times</cite> observes: “The old general, from his early
services in the cause of liberty,—from his immense sacrifices
for his country,—from his intrepid consistency
of character during a political career of forty years, during
which the world turned around him or changed its
principles several times, while he remained unchanged,
is deservedly an object of great esteem and admiration.
But why is he brought forward, or why does he make
himself prominent on this occasion, type as he is of the
Revolution? And why, when he does appear, is he so
enthusiastically received? For no other reason but because
the king has made choice of what is considered a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>counter-revolutionary cabinet, and because the people are
desirous of evincing their adherence to the free institutions
which they think at present threatened, by testifying
their grateful admiration for one of the founders
and champions of their freedom. Every shout of applause
thus uttered for General La Fayette is a shout
of defiance against the ministers; and every libation
poured to his health is a kind offering to the memory
of past struggles for liberty. The repetition of such
scenes would have been thought impossible about two
months ago.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The following description of General La Fayette’s
reception at Lyons is taken from an extract of a letter
dated Paris, Sept. 16, 1829:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“General La Fayette has paid a visit this summer to
his birthplace in Auvergne, and has been received on his
passage in a manner worthy of his noble virtues, public
as well as private. From his arrival at Chavaniac until
his entry at Lyons, in every town and village through
which he passed, he has witnessed the spontaneous homage
of the patriotism of their inhabitants. The population
of villages far distant from the road he travelled
precipitated themselves before him on his passage, and
the inhabitants of the cities through which he passed
presented themselves <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span> to welcome him within
their walls. In spite of the orders sent by the ministry
at Paris to the departmental authorities, to endeavor to
suppress as much as was in their power the preparations
made to receive the general, his triumphal march since he
left La Grange, from the borders of the river Manche, to
the foot of the Alps, has no other example in history, excepting
his visit to the United States. Escorted from
city to city by large cavalcades of horsemen, through
arches of triumph prepared for the occasion on the high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>roads, saluted continually with enthusiasm by assembled
multitudes, the thoughts of the veteran defender of
liberty were often diverted to his brilliant reception in
a distant hemisphere, whose liberties are as dear to him
as those of his native country.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Précurseur</cite></span> and <cite>Journal of Commerce</cite> of Lyons
says:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“The general arrived from Vienne on Friday, the 4th
of September, escorted by one hundred and fifty horsemen.
His arrival had been impatiently expected by the
inhabitants of Lyons, and on reaching St. Synphoria, the
deputation named to receive him were found waiting
with a large cavalcade of horsemen and carriages, and a
numerous assemblage of people who accompanied him to
Lyons. At St. Synphoria the general descended from
his carriage and was addressed by M. Prunelle, president
of the deputation, who welcomed him on the part
of the inhabitants of Lyons to this city; to which the
general replied, in retracing the kindness with which he
had been received at his last visit to that city before the
Revolution in 1789, and expressing his gratitude for the
flattering manner in which he was again received. He
then ascended into an open barouche drawn by four horses,
and conducted by two postilions, which were placed at
his disposition by the deputation, and the procession
proceeded to Lyons in the following order:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“1st. A detachment of 400 horsemen, composed of
young men from Vienne and Lyons.</p>

<p class='c030'>“2d. The carriage with the deputation from the latter
city.</p>

<p class='c030'>“3d. The barouche containing the general, Mr. George
La Fayette, and the president, M. Prunelle, surrounded
by a cohort of citizens on foot.</p>

<p class='c030'>“4th. The private carriages of the general, containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>the Misses La Fayette, Mr. Adolphe Perrier, Mr. Bradford,
United States consul, and the Count de Lasteyrie.</p>

<p class='c030'>“5th. The carriages of the committee of arrangements.</p>

<p class='c030'>“A line of private carriages then followed, and so
great were they in number, that on the arrival of the
head of the procession at the bridge Charles X. at Lyons,
the last of the carriages had but just reached the extremity
of the long Faubourg de la Gullotière, nearly two
miles distant. The spectacle which presented itself on
the entry of the general into the city was of the most
magnificent description. An immense population, estimated
at 70,000 persons, lined the bridge and streets
through which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cortège</em></span> moved, and the reiterated cries
of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive La Fayette</em></span>,’ and continued manifestation of
public joy, which filled the air during his passage to the
Hôtel du Nord, where a suite of apartments had been
prepared for him, were gratifying proofs on the part of
the enthusiastic population of Lyons, of the love and
admiration for the noble character and patriotism of
their illustrious guest. In the evening after his arrival
an orchestra of one hundred and twenty musicians serenaded
under his windows, and the hotel was surrounded
until a late hour by crowds of the curious, anxious to behold
the countenance of the prisoner of Olmütz and the
ardent defender of the liberties of France.</p>

<p class='c030'>“On the following day a splendid excursion on the
river Saone, composed of about thirty boats of various
descriptions, elegantly decorated, and some of them bearing
the banners of France and of the United States,
was prepared for the general, who embarked with his
suite at twelve o’clock, greeted by the cheers of the immense
assemblage of people who lined the borders of the
river. On the arrival of the procession at the Isle Barbe,
a salute was fired from the château of the island, whence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>after a short stay, the general returned to Lyons in time
to attend the dinner offered him and Mr. George La
Fayette by the different lodges of freemasons of that
city.</p>

<p class='c030'>“On Monday the 7th inst. the grand banquet given in
honor of the general took place at the magnificent salon
Gayet, situated on the borders of the Rhone. The rooms
were elegantly dressed with festoons, and at one end
were seen the portraits of Washington and Franklin, and
the bust of the distinguished guest crowned with a
wreath of laurels. On his arrival at four o’clock, he was
received with unanimous and reiterated cries of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Vive La
Fayette!</em></span>’ Five hundred of the inhabitants of Lyons,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>élite</em></span> of that city, sat down to a sumptuous dinner
prepared for the occasion, at which presided M. Prunelle,
assisted by thirty members of the committee of
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c030'>“At the dessert the following toasts were given:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“1. By the president—The King of France.</p>

<p class='c030'>“2. ‘General La Fayette—other warriors have been
victorious in battle, and other orators have pronounced
eloquent discourses; but none have equalled him in civic
virtues.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“General La Fayette then rose and said:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘You have been witnesses, gentlemen, of the marks of
affection and confidence with which the population of
Lyons has deigned to receive me within their walls; you
yourselves have participated in that kind reception in a
manner so flattering, and I am surrounded at this patriotic
banquet by objects of such interesting associations,
that it would be superfluous, and above all impossible, to
express to you my feelings at this moment; the remainder
of my life, gentlemen, will be consecrated to them. I am
proud and happy that my visit here has furnished another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>occasion to your city to express its constant hatred
of oppression, its love for true liberty, and its determination
to resist every attempt of the incorrigible <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>contre-revolution</em></span>.’
The general then spoke of the privileges
granted to the people by the constitution; their rights of
being tried by jury, and of elections, and of the censorship
of the press; and after having paid a just tribute to the
noble and patriotic attitude that the National Guard of
Lyons took at the important epoch of 1815, he took occasion
to examine the position of the Polignac ministry,
and the violent measures which it threatens against the
liberties of France. ‘We are menaced,’ said he, ‘by
hostile projects; but how will they be effected? Will
they succeed by means of the Chamber of Deputies? My
honorable friend and colleague, M. Couderc, now at my
side, and every one of my colleagues who are now seated
at this banquet, will attest that in the moment of danger
the Chamber of Deputies will show itself faithful to patriotism
and honor. Is it proposed to dissolve the Chamber?
If so, it will then be the business of the electors of France,
who certainly will return only deputies worthy of themselves
and of the nation.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Is it contemplated to vitiate the elections by more
ordinances, and thus exercise illegal power? Let the
partisans of such measures remember that the force of
every government exists only in the arms and in the
purses of the individuals composing the nation. The
French nation knows its rights, and knows, likewise, how
to defend them. Let us hope, however, gentlemen, that
the plots against the liberties of the people are merely
visionary, and, in the mean time, accept from me the following
toast:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘The department of the Rhone, and the city of Lyons—the
ancient metropolis of industry, and the courageous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>enemy of oppression. May its liberty, its dignity, and
its prosperity be solidly founded on the full enjoyment
of those social and natural rights which it has ever defended.’”</p>

<p class='c030'>One hundred thousand copies of a pamphlet, containing
an account of La Fayette’s late triumphal journey
were published.</p>

<p class='c030'>But this triumphal journey occasioned much chagrin
among the enemies of French liberty, and the government,
already growing more and more hostile to friends
of liberty, took petty spite upon some of their officials, as
the following will show.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Paris <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Constitutional</cite></span> announced that “the minister
of the interior has deposed the mayor and deputy-mayor
of Vizille from their functions: the former, for
having <em>congratulated</em> General La Fayette, upon his arrival
in that town; and the latter, for having appeared on horseback
when he entered.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Another French paper says:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“We stated yesterday the deposition of a mayor for
having joined in the honors to La Fayette. We now add
the proceedings to which this intended disgrace gave rise.
‘The intelligence of this event,’ says the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Précurseur</cite></span> of
Lyons, ‘inspired the inhabitants of the commune with
the greatest indignation, not being able to conceive why
peaceful citizens may not, without crime, honor one of
the worthiest public men of the nation. The whole population
assembled spontaneously in the public square;
there each one expressed his regrets, and recalled with
delight the useful and honorable acts of the displaced
magistrates. Thence they proceeded to the office of the
mayor, where these functionaries still were, and there
Mr. Romain Peyron thus spoke, in the name of his fellow-citizens:—</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>“‘<span class='sc'>Mr. Mayor and Mr. Deputy</span>: The inhabitants of
this commune have learned with the greatest pain that, by
a decree of the minister of the interior, you were deprived
of the functions you have discharged with so much zeal,
and in which you have so justly acquired the confidence
and esteem of those whom you had to serve. The motives
which have afforded the new ministry a pretext for
this act are too honorable to be made a cause for complaint!
You are, gentlemen, the first citizens stripped
of their official functions <em>for having taken part in the
honors paid to General La Fayette</em>! Let us not envy the
enemies of the public liberties this poor satisfaction
while all France is still echoing with the acclamations
which everywhere burst forth upon the passage of this
great citizen, and especially in the second city of the
kingdom!</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘The general who was the object of this enthusiasm
will live in history, in spite of the <em>calumnies of party
men</em>! The people will always recollect that he was, at
that time, the zealous defender of legal liberty, which,
among us, includes attachment to constitutional monarchy;
that, on the 5th and 6th of October, he twice
saved the lives of the royal family; that, previously to
the 10th of August, he sacrificed his popularity in order
to snatch Louis XVI. from the dangers that threatened
him; and that, proscribed for his energetic protest at
the bar of the Legislative Assembly, and arrested in a
neutral country, he expiated, in the dungeons of Austria,
the crime of having always faithfully observed the line
of duty!</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘You, gentlemen, you too, fulfilled a duty, in not
separating yourselves from all these under your care, in
those imposing circumstances when the presence of our
magistrates, as the organs of our unanimous sentiments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>added a new value to their manifestation, and ensured
tranquillity and good order in the midst of our rejoicings.</p>

<p class='c030'>“‘Receive, therefore, the expression of our thanks and
of our regret.’”</p>

<p class='c030'>These testimonies of the esteem of their fellow-citizens
abundantly compensated for the vengeance of the ministers.</p>

<p class='c030'>The prefect of the department, having designated M.
Buscaillon as provisional mayor, that respectable old man
answered, “that M. Finant having been removed by the
minister of the interior for having taken part in the honors
paid to General La Fayette, he was bound to declare
that he himself had done the same thing, together with
all the other inhabitants of the commune, and that he
could not, therefore, trouble the minister to do justice
upon another in similar error.”</p>

<p class='c030'>M. Buscaillon will long be remembered for his noble
refusal of a place dishonored by so gross intolerance.</p>

<p class='c030'>“<span class='sc'>Frenchmen!</span> France is free. Absolute power raised its
standard; the heroic population of Paris has overthrown it.
Paris, attacked, has made the sacred cause triumph by arms,—which
had triumphed in vain in the elections. A power which
usurped our rights and disturbed our repose, threatened at once
liberty and order. We return to the possession of order and
liberty. There is no more fear for acquired rights; no more
barrier between us and the rights which we still need. A government
which may without delay secure to us these advantages
is now the first want of our country. Frenchmen, those
of your deputies who are already at Paris, have assembled, and
till the Chambers can regularly intervene, they have invited a
Frenchman who has never fought but for France—the Duke of
Orleans—to exercise the function of lieutenant-general of the
kingdom. This is, in their opinion, the surest means promptly
to accomplish by peace the success of the most legitimate
defence.</p>

<p class='c030'>“The Duke of Orleans is devoted to the national and constitutional
cause. He has always defended its interests and professed
its principles. He will respect our rights, for he will
derive his own from us. We shall secure to ourselves by laws
all the guarantees necessary to liberty strong and durable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the glorious crisis in which the Parisian energy has
re-conquered our rights, everything still remains provisional;
there is nothing definitive but the sovereignty of those national
rights, and the eternal remembrance of the glorious work of the
people; but amidst the various powers instituted through the
necessity of our situation, the reorganization of the National
Guard is a most necessary defence for the public order, and
one which is highly called for. The opinion of the prince exercising
the high station of lieutenant-general of the kingdom,
is that I should, for the present, take that command. In 1790
I refused to accept such an offer, made to me by 3,000,000 of
my comrades, as that office would have been a permanent one,
and might one day have become a very dangerous one. Now
that circumstances are altered, I think it my duty, in order to
serve liberty and my country, to accept the station of general
commandant of the National Guard of France.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>The <cite>Niles Register</cite>, published at Baltimore, thus writes
at this time concerning the Revolution of 1830:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The details are long and exceedingly interesting.
Charles has abdicated the throne of France, as well as
his son, in favor of the Duke of Bordeaux, his grandson;
but the French have now so little regard for the ‘divine
rights’ of the Bourbons, as to refuse having a <em>baby</em> for
their king; and it is highly probable that the Duke of
Orleans will be invested with the sovereignty, according
to the charter, with, perhaps, some small modifications.
Our old friend, La Fayette, has so far fulfilled his best
hopes, in preserving much respect for order amidst the
bustling events that have lately happened in Paris, and
his coadjutors seem entitled to the highest praise for
the firmness and discretion with which they have acted;
but the <em>people</em> have earned even more glory by their
moderation, if it be possible, than by their valor. The
result is wonderful indeed. A complete revolution
effected in less than ten days, and extending all over
France, and the people settled down into their usual
avocations in peace! the tri-colored flag floats everywhere
in the breeze; the Marseillaise Hymn is sung in
the theatres; liberty is regained, and licentiousness has
not followed in its train!</p>

<p class='c010'>“In August the deputies proceeded in a body and on
foot, escorted by the National Guard, to the Palais Royal,
to offer the throne, which they had declared vacant, to
the Duke of Orleans. To the declaration of the Chamber,
read by M. Lafitte, in the presence of the Duke of
Orleans, he thus replied:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I receive, with profound emotion, the declaration
you present to me. I look upon it as the expression of
the national will, and it appears to me in harmony with
the principles I have professed all my life. Filled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>recollections which always have induced me to wish that
it might never be my destiny to ascend a throne, exempt
from ambition, and accustomed to the peaceful life
which I have led in the midst of my family, I cannot
conceal from you all the emotions which agitate my
heart on this most important occasion; but there is
one that overmasters them all, and that is love of my
country. I feel what it requires of me, and I will do it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“After this reply, delivered with much emotion, General
La Fayette taking the arm of the Duke of Orleans,
said in a loud voice:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘This is such a prince as I desired.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The peers speedily followed the deputies, and waited
upon the ‘citizen king,’ as they called him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The deputies having declared the throne vacant by
the flight of the king and his family, proceeded to make
certain alterations in the constitution, which, having
passed through all necessary forms, and been accepted
also by the Duke of Orleans, he took the oaths as king
of France, on the 9th of August, and was proclaimed
accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Charles X., at different periods of his reign, having,
for the purpose of obtaining a majority in the House of
Peers, created many new peers, the following proposition
was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies by M.
Berard:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“All nominations and creations of peers made under
the reign of Charles X. are declared void and of none
effect. The 27th article of the charter (giving the king
power to create peers) shall be subjected to a new discussion
in the sittings of 1831.”</p>

<p class='c010'>These propositions being before the house, General La
Fayette having ascended the tribune, amidst the most
profound silence, thus spoke:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>“In mounting this tribune for the purpose of expressing
an opinion opposed to that of many friends of liberty,
I am not yielding to a momentary impulsion, nor
am I courting popularity, which I never preferred to my
duty. (Cheers.) The republican principles which I
have professed throughout my life, and under all governments,
do not prevent me from being the defender of a
constitutional throne raised by the people. The same
sentiments animate me under the present circumstances,
when it is judged desirable to raise to a constitutional
throne, the prince lieutenant-general, and I am bound to
avow that this choice the more perfectly fulfils my
wishes the more I become acquainted with him. (Cheers.)
I do not partake in the opinion entertained by many of
my fellow-citizens as to an hereditary peerage. (Hear!
hear!) A disciple of the American school, I have
always conceived it to be necessary that the legislative
body should be divided into two chambers, differently
constituted; but I have never been able to comprehend
how people could be hereditary legislators and judges.
I have always thought that the introduction of aristocracy
into public institutions was mixing them with a
bad ingredient. It is, therefore, with great pleasure
that I find you occupied with a project that meets the
sentiments I have professed throughout my life, and
which I only now repeat. My conscience forced me to
make this repetition, and declare that I hope shortly to
see the hereditary peerage suppressed. My fellow-citizens
will do me the justice to acknowledge that if I
have always been the upholder of liberty, I have at the
same time been the supporter of public order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General La Fayette was everywhere received as a kind
father. He had many able coadjutors in the great work
performed, especially Lafitte and Gerard.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>The total number killed in Paris during the three days’
fighting in this revolution of 1830 was about eight thousand.
La Fayette and his son devoted themselves with
great kindness to the wounded, encouraging the surgeons
and personally bestowing attentions and favors upon the
sufferers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following letters written by La Fayette to various
friends at this time will give a clear and concise idea of
his opinions regarding this political upheaval in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first two were addressed by La Fayette to General
Bernard of Washington; the last, to a gentlemen in
New York.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Paris</span>, Sept. 8, 1830.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear General</span>: Abundance of news must have
reached you through the periodical papers. Nevertheless,
I think it will be pleasing to you to receive some
written details. You will have received some publications
relating to our memorable week. You will also
have read an account of the review by the king in the
Champ de Mars, for the distribution of our tri-colored
flags to the National Guard. The ceremony was as splendid
as that of the federation of 1790. We had five hundred
thousand spectators, and every one was struck with
the celerity with which in less than three weeks we have
organized nearly fifty thousand men of National Guard—armed,
equipped, and filing off like veteran troops. The
king handed successively to the general commander-in-chief
the forty-eight tri-colored flags, each surmounted
with a cock in lieu of the old imperial eagle, with this
motto, ‘Liberty—Public Order—Days of 27th, 28th,
29th, July, 1830.’ The commander-in-chief took himself
the new oath, and had it administered to the National
Guard. The colors were entrusted to flag-bearers selected
from among the mechanics who had distinguished themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>in fighting in the barricades. The National Guard
are organizing throughout France. We have already
fourteen thousand men for the two arrondissements only
of St. Denis and Seaux.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I send to you the order of the day which I addressed
to the National Guard of the kingdom. Next week a
law will be proposed for the final organization of the
French National Guard. All the citizens will compose
the stationary guard; the young men the movable
National Guard. From seven to eight hundred thousand
fighting men will thus form good corps of reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know that some disturbances have taken place
in Belgium; they will end, I think, by the separation of
that country from Holland, under the same sovereign.
We have not interfered except to signify that we shall
not suffer that any foreign army should exercise any
right of interference, leaving the nations to manage their
own affairs according to their will, but not willing that
other governments shall interfere to oppress our neighbors.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I send you the exact account of what has taken place
in the Chamber relative to South America and Mexico.
You will see that I took care to mark the order of the
recognitions already made, and to give to our dear United
States the share which belongs to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our republican throne has been recognized immediately
by the English government, and will soon, I hope, be
recognized by the other powers. You will readily suppose
that I did not say that <em>this was the best of republics</em>. I do
not think so; and the constitution of the United States
appears to me far preferable. But I believe we have done
for the best in the present circumstances; and have prepared
under a popular throne all republican institutions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>There are not in France patriots more sincere and enlightened
than the king and his son. I knew them but
little before, but they have inspired me with the greatest
friendship and confidence; and this sentiment is
reciprocal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This, my dear general, is the point at which we have
arrived. I do not mention to you some slight disturbances
or errors among the mechanics. There is not in
all this any ill intention, and reasoning alone has been
sufficient to persuade them. After all, most of these
slight disorders of which our adversaries have made so
much have been instigated by disguised enemies; and
there have been no real troubles but at Nismes; and the
zeal of the neighboring National Guard and that of the
line, under the tri-colored flag, soon repressed them.</p>

    <div class='c000'>“<em>To the National Guards of the Kingdom of France,</em></div>
    <div><em>Sept. 1, 1830.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The general commanding-in-chief the National Guard
of the kingdom, called by the confidence of the people to
the head of the public forces in the glorious days of our
late revolution, has thought it his duty, notwithstanding
his refusal in 1790, to accept under the new state of
things the important command conferred on him by the
confidence of a patriot monarch, himself placed by the
wishes of his fellow-citizens on the constitutional throne
of the king of the French. But in consideration of the
importance and multiplicity of his duties, the general
commander-in-chief must necessarily rely (of which he
has, indeed, the happy certainty) on the patriotism, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the zeal, and, he may be permitted to add, the personal
affection of his brothers in arms throughout the vast extent
of our brave and free country of France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After forty years of memorable vicissitudes the old
tri-colored flag of ’89, the flag of the national sovereignty,
of liberty, and of public order, has just been gloriously,
generously, and forever re-established; around this standard
has rallied, with a spontaneous movement, and will
soon be legally organized, all France in arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The French people, profiting by the lessons of experience,
by the progress of light and civic intelligence,
and appreciating the glory and benefits of our political
storms, casting off all that deprived their first impulses
of their purity, feel much the more necessity for general
and personal security, now that the happy division of
property and the advancement of industry render it more
and more necessary. Filled with respect and good will for
the rights of other nations, and their bosoms glowing with
ardor for all the rights, without distinction, of individual,
civil and religious liberty, they cannot but maintain
with firmness, and if it be necessary defend with energy,
their own rights of independence, liberty, of legal order,
the laws to which they have consented, and the popular
throne which they have founded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the National Guard to whom these great duties
are particularly confided; and as no foreign influence
can prevail against the French nation, proud as she is of
her retrospections, of her strength, and of the great and
virtuous example she has just presented to the world,
holding in her hands the sacred arms of liberty; so
neither can any domestic intrigue, any of those temptations
to disorder which the odious tactics of our adversaries
formerly rendered so oppressive, now triumph
over the spirit of wisdom, moderation, and at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>time of energy and persevering patriotism, which now
characterize France as it is, and which was so admirably
evinced by her brave men during <em>the three great
days</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The general commander-in-chief, ready at all times
to assist his fellow-soldiers with all the efforts of his
devotion and of his personal independence, communicates
to them this day some provisionary instructions through
the medium of the inspector-general, whose long experience
has greatly aided his labors.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There will be no delay by the government in the
presentation of a law for the final organization of the
National Guard. It will have for its basis the law of
’91, and especially the vital principle of election by the
citizens; but this is only an additional motive for forwarding
at present with all our zeal the spontaneous
movement which does honor and gives strength to
France, and which presents her such as she ought to
be to her friends, and, in case of need, to her enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much I should wish to be with you, my dear
general, to rejoice together in the result of this last
glorious and virtuous revolution. The people alone have
achieved the whole; they have shown themselves as
great in the victory as daring and intrepid in the struggle.
Bodies of courageous mechanics were led by young
students, and chiefly by pupils of the Polytechnique
School, who were far more admirable than I can express.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our losses, during these three bloody days, have been
great; those of our adversaries have been considerable.
No sooner was a regiment engaged in the streets to carry
off the barricades than new ones were thrown up in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>rear. The attacks on the Louvre, Tuileries, and Hôtel
de Ville were made with incredible valor. Levasseur
was severely wounded, but we shall save him. I was, on
the morning of the third day, established in the Hôtel
de Ville, which had been taken and retaken; and the tricolored
flag was waving over our heads. The king having
halted at Rambouillet with ten or twelve thousand
men, I ordered from fifteen to twenty thousand Parisians
to march against him; the enemy retreated. Afterwards
the Count d’Artois and family reached the port of
embarkation, under the escort of our commissaries, without
receiving the least insult during their journey through
the French territory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The National Guard is organizing throughout France.
The king we have elected is patriotic and popular. I
would not say, as has been reported, that this is the best
of republics, but I do say that it is a very republican
monarchy, susceptible of improvement.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following letter was written by La Fayette to a
friend in New York:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“We might have declared a pure republic; but not
without a great division of opinion, nor without danger
both internal and external. And therefore the republicans
generously preferred uniting themselves to the moderate
monarchists (perhaps the majority of the nation),
on condition that it should be a <em>republican</em> monarchy.
The Duke of Orleans was chosen by the Chamber of Deputies
in the name of the people, who seem well satisfied;
and having recognized the principle that he derives his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>title from the will of the people, Louis Philippe reascends
a popular throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not say, as some newspapers related it, ‘that
this was the best of republics.’ I declared, on the contrary,
my doctrines, which are of the American school;
but I perceive that, under all the circumstances, this is
the best thing to be done; and from what I have since
seen of the new king and his family, I am confirmed in
the opinion that we have done right.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have now entered a progressive career of legislation,
which will lead to a very liberal state of things.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thus the cause of the people—the liberty of Europe—has
made in three days an immense stride, and this
new revolution has sustained a character for disinterestedness,
grandeur of soul, and generosity, which places
what are called the lowest orders of the people in the
first rank of French society. France is now her own
sovereign, and every day confirms her title.</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>La Fayette.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The following are extracts of a letter of the Parisian
correspondent of the London <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>. Its
date is the 8th of August.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we shall have peace! But believe me, that
question depends on the voice of one man—and that
man is General La Fayette. If, on Friday night, when
twelve thousand of the bravest and most intelligent of the
youths of Paris marched down to the Chamber of Deputies
to demand that there should be no hereditary peerage, and,
in fact, no Chamber of Peers; if, I say, at that moment
General La Fayette had said to those brave young men,
‘Yes, my friends, we will have a republic,’ before twenty-four
hours France would have been declared a republic by
the people. I do not say by the peers—by the deputies—by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the bankers—by the rich merchants, or men of
property; but I do say, by the people. And even yesterday
if, in the Chamber of Deputies, when La Fayette rose
to address the house, when there was the silence of death,
and when each one dared not to breathe till they heard
some words from the republican hero—if then La Fayette
had said, ‘Gentlemen, I protest against your proceedings.
France shall have a charter—but shall not
have a king,’ France would have had no king, and France
would have maintained her position though millions
should have been slain. It is to General La Fayette that
the Duke of Orleans owes the crown, which to-morrow
will be placed upon his head. The Royalists and Ultra-royalists
were prepared, to a man, to support the Republican
party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another correspondent of the London papers pays La
Fayette the following compliment:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amidst various admirable plans and measures, I
must direct your attention above all to a proposition of
abolishing the punishment of death. La Fayette gave a
distinguishing proof of the real nature of his spirit by
seconding, in a time of revolution, the abolishment of
this penalty. He is no dealer in men’s lives—no hunter
after blood. He saved Louis XVI. from the fury of a
mob, Charles X. from destruction, the state from anarchy;
and now he would even protect from ignominious
death the authors of those fatal ordinances which
have produced the shedding of so much blood, and left
so many to mourn over the loss of husband, father, and
friend. France is erecting to La Fayette a splendid
monument: but posterity will do more; our grandchildren
will call him the saviour of the liberties of
France.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Chamber of Deputies, on the 21st of August, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>proposition being submitted to abolish the punishment
of death (on which no decision had been made), General
La Fayette rose and said:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I conceive, differing with my honorable colleague,
that the abolition of the penalty of death is a principle,
or rather a sentiment, that ought to be at once examined.
It is no new idea that is now laid before you—the
abolition of this penalty has been called for at
every period; it was demanded by some highly respectable
members of the Constituent Assembly, by Adrian
Duport; it was demanded by the father of our honorable
friend, the author of the commentary on Montesquieu.
How deeply have we all to regret that it had
not been abolished ages back! It is in the present day
loudly called for in the United States of America.
From this, gentlemen, you will perceive that many have
formed a decided opinion upon the subject. For my own
part, I shall demand the abolition of the penalty of death
until I am convinced that human judgment is infallible.
What frightful use of this penalty was made during our
former revolution. The reflection fills my soul with
horror! No man, I believe, ever made use of it during
those disastrous times, without afterwards wishing it
were possible he could redeem with his own blood the
condemnations in which he had joined. But our present
revolution has a character of generosity as well as of
patriotism, and it would adorn its commencement were
we to consummate this act of humanity. I, therefore,
vote for its being taken into consideration.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Extract of a letter from Paris, dated Aug. 10, to the
editor of the Boston <cite>Sentinel</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“General La Fayette can now be ranked with Washington
without exaggeration. His late conduct has
capped the climax of his glory. Few people at present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>realize the degree to which he is entitled to our admiration.
When, on the first day of the contest, I was told
that he had come to Paris from La Grange to accept the
dangerous post of leader of the armed people, I could
hardly credit the news. Who could then have divined
the issue? And had it not proved successful, think of
the terrible consequence to the old veteran. To escape
to America with his life was the utmost he could have
hoped in such an event. But he not only accepted the
command, but did not fear to appear on horseback in
military dress, in various parts of Paris, in prosecution
of his arduous undertaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But his fearless devotion to the cause of liberty constitutes
the smallest part of his claim to our admiration.
It is his magnanimity, his wonderful disinterestedness,
and the purity of his patriotism that rank him with
Washington. It must be recollected that he is an avowed
republican, that he has always desired a republic for
France. And yet the new king, Louis Philippe, is indebted
to him personally for his crown. Yes, I am confident
of this extraordinary fact. It is not generally known
that a republic would certainly have been established, of
which La Fayette might have been at the head, had it
not been for his noble and disinterested preference of his
country to himself. But he reflected that a republic, at
this crisis, would be at the risk of foreign or civil war,
or both. He was not afraid of either. He knew that he
and the people could maintain a republic against both
foreign and domestic foes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he knew, also, that the Duke of Orleans would
make a ‘republican king,’ and at the same time not endanger
the public tranquillity. The magnanimous La Fayette
then did not hesitate to give the duke his support,
without which he never could have reigned. This I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>gather, not from newspapers, but from the state of the
public mind expressed in innumerable ways, and particularly
when the people came so near stopping the deliberations
of the Chamber of Deputies the other day, and
when nobody could calm them but La Fayette. People
now cry about the streets medals of La Fayette, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>père des

<p class='c010'>A Paris paper says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A great many women took an active part in the
combats in Paris, and several distinguished themselves
by feats of extraordinary courage. A young and pretty
girl, nineteen years of age, who, during the three days,
appeared in front of the combatants armed with a musket,
acquired such an ascendency over the citizens that they
regarded her almost as their captain. Intrepid on the
field of battle, she lavished her kind attentions on the
wounded when the firing had ceased. So much heroism,
devotion, and humanity excited the enthusiasm of all
who witnessed it. On Saturday night this young girl
was borne in triumph through the streets of Paris. A
great crowd accompanied her, shouting cries of joy. In
one hand she held a sword, and in the other the tricolored
flag. Lighted torches shed a brilliancy on this
gay <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cortège</em></span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>The <cite>Niles Register</cite>, February, 1831, thus describes the
resignation of La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sitting of the Chamber of Deputies on the 27th
of December, 1830, was numerously attended in consequence
of the extraordinary degree of interest excited
by recent occurrences. The Chamber was proceeding to
the discussion of the law relative to the National Guard
when La Fayette entered, and was received with universal
applause, upwards of one hundred members going up
to him and shaking his hand. The general then went <a id='corr416.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to to'>to</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_416.10'><ins class='correction' title='to to'>to</ins></a></span> the president, and after a short conversation with
him, addressed the Chamber as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘In a neighboring nation it is the custom when a citizen
retires from a distinguished office, for him to come
before his fellow-citizens and explain the cause, and I
am sure the Chamber will grant me the same favor. I
have always considered that the post of commander-in-chief
of the National Guard of France was incompatible
with a constitutional monarchy, except under circumstances
of the most absolute necessity. It was this conviction
that led me in 1790, when 3,000,000 of National
Guards wished to elect me their commander at the federation
by 14,000 deputies, to apply to the Constituent
Assembly, and urge them to issue a decree in opposition
to this desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Such still was my opinion when the lieutenant-general
of the kingdom, who has since become our king,
wished me to accept the same appointment, and I felt
myself bound to accept it, but always retaining the intention
of laying it down as soon as I was satisfied that
it was no longer necessary for me to continue to hold it;
earlier if peace remained unbroken, but at a later period
had war ensued. The declared opinion of the Chamber
has hastened the period, and out of respect for it I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>not waited till the law was submitted to the other branches
of the state.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is merely a matter of date; but I should be deeply
hurt if any one imagined—and no one who has been
acquainted with me during the last fifty-four years of
my life can believe—that my conduct has been dictated
by any personal feeling. I will go further, and say that
this opinion of the Chamber has afforded me an opportunity.
The high authority with which I was invested
has given umbrage which you, gentlemen, must have
heard of; and this umbrage has even been felt in certain
diplomatic circles. The cause is now at an end, and I
have no other honor than that of being one of your colleagues.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘One word more, gentlemen: I should not have given
in my resignation, which the king has accepted with all
that goodness he has ever shown toward me, before the
crisis we have now happily gotten over was at an end.
At this time my conscientious love of public order is
satisfied, but I cannot say the same of my conscientious
love of liberty. We must all recollect the programme
announced at the Hôtel de Ville,—a popular throne supported
by republican institutions. It was accepted, but
we have not all put the same construction upon it: it
has not always been interpreted by the councils of the
king in the same sense in which it was understood by
me, who am more impatient than others that it should
be realized; and whatever may have been my personal
independence in all situations I feel myself at the present
moment more at my ease in discussing my opinions
with you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘For the rest, there are points upon which we shall
always be in accord: we shall ever be united against our
enemies, whether at home or from abroad. I still think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>that in the measures taken in the revolution of July we
not only did that which we verily believed was for the
best, but that we did all that was possible to be done. I
am the more convinced of this since I have become intimately
acquainted with the personage we have placed
on the throne. On throwing off my uniform I have not
changed my motto, “Liberty, Public Order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Besides, how many legal means we have of expressing
our thoughts and making our wishes known; for
there is the tribune of this Chamber, and for every citizen
there is the press which has rendered the country so
many services; and then there is the peaceable mode of
petitions. Having thus yielded to my desire of laying
all my sentiments before you, I trust I shall still and
ever retain your esteem and friendship.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With what feelings,” says the <cite>National Gazette</cite>, “must
the government of Austria view the present situation of
La Fayette, whom it so long held as a malefactor in a
dungeon! It is stated of Franklin that when he signed
at Paris the treaty of alliance between the United Colonies
and France, he put on the same coat which he wore
when he was grossly insulted by Widderburn and the
lords of the Privy Council in London. If La Fayette has
retained the suit in which he escaped from Olmütz, he
might resume it by the side of Philip when the Austrian
ambassador has his first audience of the <em>citizen king</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><cite>Niles Register</cite>, November, 1830, quotes the following
speech of La Fayette in the French Chamber of Deputies:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At a recent sitting of the Chamber, General La Fayette
made the following remarks relative to the suppression
of the slave trade. Our readers will see that on this,
as on all other occasions, he was careful to render justice
to the United States, whose character or institutions he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>omits no proper opportunity of holding up to respect and
admiration. The annunciation of the minister of the
marine is important as to destroying the distinction of
color.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>General La Fayette.</span> ‘I feel always ready to unite
in whatever tends to alleviate the unfortunate condition
of the ancient and unhappy colony of St. Domingo; but
after the debate which has just occupied our attention
the Chamber will not be disappointed if I pass over the
present question to the situation of the colonies which
are still in our possession. I regret very much that, at
the time of the Constituent Assembly, the resolutions
were not persisted in, which united the free people of
color with the other colonists, in declaring them entitled
to the same rights. I also wish that the slave trade had
been rigorously interdicted, and that a law for the gradual
abolition of slavery had prevented the misfortunes
occasioned by a sudden and imprudent emancipation.
And, since, have we not had sufficient reason to lament
this consular and imperial system, which sent our best
troops to perish in the sad expedition to St. Domingo,
and which caused the double outrage of re-establishing
slavery and the slave trade at a time when none but
French capital was engaged in this infamous traffic?
Now, gentlemen, after so many sacrifices and misfortunes,
we find ourselves behind with many other nations,
at least in the suppression of the slave trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The United States first, the English immediately
afterwards, have assimilated it with piracy, the only
means of repressing it, whilst the guilty can obtain pecuniary
indemnification from those who employ them,
who, for example, send ships to St. Thomas to carry on
the direct trade for slaves. It is to avoid consuming
time with special propositions and reference to the offices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>that I entreat the minister of marine, who is present
(and of whose favorable intentions in this respect I am
well aware), to communicate to us, decidedly, the determination
of government on this subject, and on the
condition of the free men of color in our colonies.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>The Minister of Marine.</span> ‘I have the honor of
stating to the Chamber that I agree entirely in the justice
and humanity of the sentiments manifested by the
illustrious general who has just descended from the tribune.
The government proposes to present to the Chamber
a law which will condemn all those to the penalties of
piracy, who engage for the future in this infamous trade
for human beings. It must be acknowledged that the
trade has diminished, though, in spite of the precautions
taken by government, it still exists in a great degree.
The penalties enacted against piracy can alone suppress
it entirely. Something may, at this time, however, be
mentioned honorable to France, which is, that of all the
European nations who have a maritime commerce, she is
least of all given to this odious traffic. As to the fate
of the free people of the colonies, the government acknowledges
that free men can no longer exist in different
conditions; thus the legislation which will be presented
to you will give you an opportunity of consecrating this
principle, that all free men, of whatever class or color
they may be, are equal in the eyes of the law.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chamber ordered the petition to be referred to the
ministers of finance and foreign affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the sitting of the Chamber of Deputies, on the 14th
of December, 1830, speaking of certain propositions concerning
the National Guard, La Fayette said:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I decline to enter into the question of cantons and
communes. But if I am asked if you are now to discuss
whether all France shall be armed, I answer, the question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>is already decided; the people did not wait in 1789, or
in 1830, to deliberate, but marched against the enemy
[sensation]; we must, therefore, prepare for war, as the
best means of securing peace. We cannot hope to make
all Europe in love with our institutions; there are those
who still look with a jaundiced eye upon the accession of
a citizen king to our throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The revolution of Belgium, the eldest daughter of
one great week, may yet excite uneasiness. At this
moment you see Poland [Hear, hear!] ready to rival, in
zeal and patriotism, the friends of liberty, not only in
France, but in all other countries [fresh movements].
Poland [Hear, hear!] is, perhaps, upon the point of repairing
the shame of the last year of Louis XV., and the
immense fault which Napoleon committed when he neglected
the occasion of restoring that fine country, after
the three divisions which had destroyed it [loud acclamations
from the left].</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have announced our rule to be that we will not
allow other powers to interfere, not only in our affairs,
but in the affairs of other countries. Suppose foreign
powers should think proper to seize upon Belgium, or to
assist Holland; could we look on in cold blood? Certainly
not [loud cheers]. The same thing may happen
on the side of Poland. Suppose Austria, prevailed upon
by Prussia, or for any selfish purpose of her own, was to
make herself a party to the quarrel in Russian Poland—”
[violent murmurs and marks of disapprobation. Several
voices, “This supposition is unreasonable.”].</p>

<p class='c010'>M. La Fayette (turning towards General Sebastian). “I
speak in the presence of the minister of foreign affairs,
who knows that the supposition is very natural. Why
not, then, place ourselves in the fittest posture for defence?”
[cheers].</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>La Fayette thus sums up the results obtained by the
Revolution of 1830, in a paper found among his manuscripts:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The victory having been entirely popular, it has baffled
the combinations of the liberal aristocracy as much
as those of the aristocratic nobility and of foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The dynasty of right divine has been expelled; the
national sovereignty has been not only recognized, but
exercised, more clearly than it had ever been in Europe,
because, in the English Revolution of 1788, there were
applied again in England the principles of legitimacy.
William III. was elected because he was son-in-law of
James II. and to avoid breaking the line of succession:
the acts were signed William and Mary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the French Revolution of ’89, the national sovereignty
found itself declared in the right, but in fact
had preserved the line legitimate, in the person of Louis
XVI. To-day the crown has been given in the name of
the people, and accepted as such by Louis Philippe, who
is called thus because he had in his family six predecessors
of that name. He was not saluted king only after
he had signed and sworn to the conditions imposed upon
him, in the name of the people, and ratified by the unhesitating
assent of the population of Paris and of the
departments.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The National Guard have been re-established in an
original institution; arms have been given to all Frenchmen;
the officers have been chosen by the citizens, very
much the same as in the United States they are nominated
by the executive power. It is certainly a militia,
the most universal and the most democratic which has
ever existed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The liberty of the press has been rendered complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>by the suppression of obstacles which yet existed, because
one can regard as already decreed those proposed resolutions
relative to printers, to libraries, and to securities.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trial by jury has been applied not only to the
press, but also to other political misdemeanors, with
immense advantage, and one will hear soon of applying
the jury to other questions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The absurdities relative to double voting have been
suppressed by the nomination of definite presidents and
provisionary bureaux, by executive power. The age
required for the electors has been reduced from thirty
years to twenty-five, and for those eligible, from forty to
thirty. It is conceded in advance that the new electoral
law will lower the census as much for the electors as for
those eligible, unless even that should be entirely suppressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The succession to the Chamber of Peers has received
a blow from which it cannot recover itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tri-colored flag is re-established throughout all
France, and carries into all foreign countries the love
and the example of liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The municipalities, the councils of departments,
chosen by the old government from amongst the enemies
of liberty, have been replaced by elective administrations,
and established as a sort of republican and administrative
federation. Behold then, in spite of hesitations,
obstacles, and delays, we have advanced thus far at present!
It remains to know what we have to do, for a
complete revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. To lower as much as we can the census of the
new electoral law; even to introduce there, if possible,
such amendments as shall tend to give an indirect participation
of the representation of the people to those who
are not admitted by election.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>“2. To render the administration, communal and departmental,
as popular as we can, increasing their importance
and diminishing that of the prefects who have
not been commissioned by the executive power.</p>

<p class='c010'>“3. That each Chamber of Deputies should find itself
reorganized into a large party by more than one hundred
resignations, which will give to each side a force of
nearly one hundred voices; and as it will be at present
impossible to dissolve the Chamber before the end of the
session, as certain laws pertaining to the National
Guard necessitate the continuation of the actual session,
it is desirable that the next session should give to
us a new Chamber; since the new law, though imperfect,
will necessarily be very much preferable to the actual
law.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There will surely be a great diminishing of the civil
list, and of the reforms appertaining to the budget. As
to the rest, those of the budget can be modified at each
session. It is necessary to demand the reform of the
penal code.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette here leaves this paper unfinished, but
enough is given to form an opinion of his ideas of political
reform.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following is from <cite>Galigani’s Messenger</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A deputation of gentlemen from Philadelphia have
been received at the Hôtel de Ville by the prefect of the
Seine. The Americans presented an address expressive
of the admiration entertained by the inhabitants of Philadelphia
for the noble conduct of the Parisians during
the glorious days of July. The deputation was introduced
by General La Fayette. In the evening a grand
dinner was given in honor of the occasion, at which Mr.
Rives, the American minister, returned thanks for a
toast of ‘the United States and the health of President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>Jackson’; in this speech Mr. Rives addressed the company
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Permit me, gentlemen, to thank you for the honor
you have done my country,—an honor, it may, at least,
claim to merit by its cordial sentiments for France. It
was my good fortune, gentlemen, to be an eye-witness of
your glorious revolution of July, and to see, with unbounded
admiration, how a population—brave and generous—can
be forbearing after having been subjected to
the most terrific trials; and what moderation it can exercise
in the midst of a victory purchased by so many
noble sacrifices. But it was not necessary to have been
a personal witness of your revolution to admire and appreciate
it. At the distance of more than a thousand
leagues beyond the Atlantic Ocean it has been felt and
appreciated in all its noble grandeur.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The three memorable days have been hailed by
every people as the triumph of human liberty; but
with us, they have given rise to the same rejoicings
as our national victories; we have celebrated your 29th
July, as we celebrate our own 4th of July, with illuminations,
processions, salutes, and all the demonstrations
of patriotic exultation. This is a proof that the ties
which formerly connected the two nations in a glorious
alliance, still retain all their moral force; the evidence
of a sympathy and fidelity to ancient recollections,
which, I hope, will insure their cordial union under the
auspices of an enlightened and upright king, whose
constitutional throne and noble character present the
best of guarantees at the same time for his own people
and for foreign powers. I have the honor to propose
a toast, which emanates from the bottom of all American
hearts—“The king of the French, and the French
nation.”’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>We cannot resist adding an extract from the animated
speech of General La Fayette upon this occasion:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here I find, happily mingled together, all the recollections—all
the sentiments and feelings of my life. I
am surrounded by the grandsons of my early American
companions, the sons of my comrades of ’89, and my
new brethren in arms of 1830. In this Hôtel de Ville,
twice the cradle of the freedom of Europe, have this day
been presented the resolutions of the city of Philadelphia—of
that city where, on the 4th of July, 1776, was
proclaimed the declaration of independence, the date of
a new era of liberty for the two worlds—of a liberty
that, for the first time, was founded upon the genuine
rights of the human race.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Five years ago, at the commemoration of a great anniversary
at Boston, on proposing as a toast, ‘The emancipation
of the American hemisphere,’ which had been
effected in the course of half a century, I prophesied
that before the next fiftieth anniversary came round, the
toast would be, ‘The emancipation of Europe.’ May
this prediction be verified! A disciple of the American
school, as you all well know,—and were I capable of
forgetting it, there are many who would remind me of it,—it
is most natural that I should drink to the memory of
my teacher—my adopted father: I propose to you, ‘The
memory of Washington.’”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,
 And all are slaves besides.”—<span class='sc'>Cowper.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“LA FAYETTE was tall and well proportioned. He
was decidedly inclined to stoutness, though not to
obesity. His head was large; his face oval and regular;
his forehead lofty and open; his eyes, which were full of
goodness and intelligence, were large and prominent, of a
grayish blue, and surmounted with light and well-arched,
but not bushy eyebrows; his nose was aquiline; his
mouth, which was habitually embellished with a natural
smile, was seldom opened except to utter kind and gracious
expressions; his complexion was clear; his cheeks
were slightly colored, and, at the age of seventy-seven,
not a single wrinkle furrowed his countenance, the ordinary
expression of which was that of candor and frankness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gifted with a strong and vigorous constitution, which
was not developed till late in life, and which was enfeebled
neither by the vicissitudes of a career passed amidst
political convulsions, nor by the sufferings and privations
which he underwent during his captivity, La Fayette,
notwithstanding his advanced age, enjoyed his intellectual
faculties to their full extent, and was rendered by
his moral energy superior to circumstances which bow
down or crush the generality of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the latter years of his life his health was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>good, or at most troubled at but rare intervals by slight
indispositions, or by transient fits of gout....</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette’s sight was excellent; but of late his
hearing had lost something of its delicacy, and the circumstance
was the more perceptible whenever he felt
indisposed. His perceptions, both morally and physically
speaking, were keen, and he usually gave free
vent to the manifestations of his agreeable impressions.
Those of a contrary nature his strength of mind enabled
him to support, or at least to dissemble, in order that
he might spare his friends the knowledge of his
sufferings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His physiognomy, which was habitually calm, gave a
faithful reflection of the movements of his soul, and at
times assumed much expression, though it was less under
the influence of his sensations than of his sentiments.
According to the circumstances in which he was placed,
joy, hope, pity or gratitude, tenderness or severity, were
by turns predominant in his eyes and in every feature of
his countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His deportment was noble and dignified, but his gait,
since the year 1803, was rather constrained, in consequence
of the accident of a broken thigh, which compelled
him to lean on his cane when walking, and prevented
him from sitting down with ease and quickness,
on account of a stiffness in the hip joint. His other
movements were easy and natural, and though he had
but little suppleness in his fingers, his gestures were
graceful, and rarely abrupt, even in the moments when his
conversation was most animated. The tone of his voice was
naturally serious, soft, and agreeable, or strong and sonorous,
according to the circumstances under which he
spoke. When the subject of conversation was gay, he
laughed heartily, but even the excess of his mirth was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>never displayed in sudden and violent bursts of laughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He dined at home as often as possible, and his frugal
meal invariably consisted of a little fish and the wing of
a chicken; he drank nothing but water. I have not the
least doubt that his sobriety and temperance, and the
regularity of his regimen, greatly contributed to exempt
him from the infirmities of old age.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette’s dress was always extremely simple, and
free from everything like pretension. He usually wore
a long gray or dark-colored great-coat, a round hat, pantaloons,
and gaiters, as represented in the full-length portrait
executed some years ago by M. Scheffer, and which
resembles him in every respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was remarkably clean and neat in his person, even
to minuteness, and for this reason his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>valet de chambre</em></span>,
Bastien, who had been long in his service, and never
quitted him, became at last indispensable for his comfort....</p>

<p class='c010'>“During his latter years, La Fayette led an agreeable
and regular existence, every instant of his time having
its stated occupation. His moments of recreation were
spent with his family, or amongst a circle of intimate
friends, on whom he bestowed the hours not devoted to
his legislative labors or to his numerous correspondents.
He ever regarded time as a gift of which the best use was
to be made, and, according to his own expression, ‘he was
not at liberty to lose it himself, and still less to occasion
the loss of it to others.’ If he was not always exact to
the hour of appointment given or accepted by him, the
multiplicity of his engagements and his preoccupation of
mind were the cause of the delay; but in important cases
his punctuality was praiseworthy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He never indulged in any of those social games to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>which people have recourse by way of amusement, or to
kill time, as the phrase is generally used. He was fond
of the country, and, when not detained in Paris by business,
usually retired to La Grange, where his existence
was altogether patriarchal.”</p>

<div id='i514'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i-514.jpg' alt='Entrance to Château La Grange' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>M. Cloquet in his quaint book of Recollections of La
Fayette, gives a full and interesting description of La
Fayette’s home at La Grange, of the grounds, château,
La Fayette’s library, museum, and many curiosities gathered
there. As Cloquet was his family surgeon and
warm personal friend for years, as well as a frequent
visitor to the La Fayette estate, and was also present at
the death-bed of the illustrious general, his account may
be deemed authentic. From his long and detailed description,
covering more than one hundred pages, the following
prominent features are here culled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The estate of La Grange is situated thirteen leagues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>east of Paris. The château stands in the centre of a
farm containing eight hundred French acres. The roads
leading to the château cross the property, and are well
laid out and carefully kept in order. The entrance into
the park is through a wide, handsome avenue bordered
with apple-trees. This avenue, turning to the left, passes
by the farm and an old chapel, and crossing a plantation
of chestnut-trees, extends for some distance through a
grove of dark-green ornamental trees until it reaches the
château. The drawbridge, which formerly existed over
the moat, has been replaced by a stone bridge with parapets.
The entrance is by a large door composed of two
arches, the one having on the sides two deep excavations
which received a portion of the woodwork and the
chains of the old bridge, the other forming the real
door. On either side of the door rises a substantial
stone tower, in which narrow windows are pierced. The
walls to the level of the tiled roof, by which they are
surmounted, are covered with moss and tufted ivy, between
the foliage of which may be seen the outline of
the casement of the towers. The ivy was planted by the
celebrated Charles Fox, during his stay at La Grange
with General Fitzpatrick, after the Peace of Amiens.
The court, through which is the entrance, has the form
of an irregular square, and is light and spacious, and
looks out upon the beautiful park on which it opens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following view of the château was furnished by
General Carbonel, and represents part of the park, lawn,
and residence. The château has two stories besides the
ground floor. The walls are covered on the outside with
ivy, Virginia jasmins, etc., and the entire dwelling is
surrounded with fine trees and enormous weeping willows,
which gracefully bend their branches towards the
waters of the moat, which is from thirty to forty feet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>breadth and seven feet in depth. The moat has been
filled up on one side of the château, leaving a level passage
to the lawn. The waters of the moat are clear and
limpid, being fed by a stream that runs from one of the
ponds of the farm, and fine fish are kept in it. On the
outside it is surrounded with terraced slopes of green
sward enamelled with brilliant flowers.</p>

<div id='i516'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i-516.jpg' alt='Château La Grange' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>On the ground floor of the château, and communicating
with the vestibule, are a small chapel, a large dining-room,
and further on, the kitchens. A wide stone staircase,
well lighted, leads to the two reception-rooms, to the La
Fayette museum, and to the corridors which conduct to
the other apartments of the family, and to those reserved
for friends.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>La Fayette’s apartments on the second floor consist
of an ante-chamber, a bedroom, and a library, the windows
of which look out upon the park, and command a
view of the farm beyond. At the entrance of the vestibule
are two small pieces of cannon, which the Parisians
at the period of the Revolution of 1830 had mounted
upon coach-wheels to attack the troops of Charles X.
The conquerors afterwards presented them to La Fayette.
Near the cannons a white cockatoo reposes on his
perch. This fine bird was presented to the general by
his friend Benjamin Constant because the cockatoo had
always shown a marked preference for La Fayette, and
welcomed his coming with joy, while to M. Constant’s
other guests the bird was quite indifferent. The small
chapel, opening on the vestibule, is now hung with black
and devoted to the exclusive use of the family. The
altar is adorned with an ivory crucifix and with silver
candelabra. Two tablets on the wall contain Scripture
quotations and passages from the Book of Tobias.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the wall of the vestibule, facing the great door of
the salon, may be seen a trophy of flags, artistically
grouped, and recalling historical events. Amongst them
are flags belonging to the old Paris National Guard of
1789, also tri-colored flags borne in the Revolution of
1830, together with several American and Polish flags.
In one of the large reception-rooms are marble busts of
Monroe and Quincy Adams, Presidents of the United
States. Over the door is a painting representing the
Port of Passage in Spain, where La Fayette first embarked
for America. The <em>Victory</em> is shown just setting
sail from the harbor. To the right and left of the door
are two other fine paintings. One represents the French
Federation in the Champ de Mars; the other, the storming
of the Bastile. The latter painting was exhibited in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>the Louvre in 1790. La Fayette was examining it there
with much enthusiasm, and exclaimed to his friend beside
him, while gazing upon the stirring scene with
ardent admiration, “Whoever becomes the possessor of
that picture will be a happy man!” The artist, Robert,
was at that moment standing behind La Fayette, and
hearing the remark he advanced and said, “General, be
happy; that picture is yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the wall to the right of this reception-room hang
beautiful engravings of the American Declaration of
Independence and the Farewell Address of President
Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the most interesting ornaments in this room
is a marble bust of La Fayette, sculptured by the artist
David, and placed on a small pedestal between the portraits
of Washington and Franklin. The flag of the
American frigate, the <em>Brandywine</em>, shades the portraits
of these three friends, seemingly uniting their memories
by its azure folds, while its silver stars float above their
heads. Washington, La Fayette, and Franklin form an
illustrious trio of immortal names. The second reception-room
may be called the American Gallery. On one side
stands a handsome bronze bust of Washington by the
artist David. Above this bust hang the portraits of
John Adams, and Quincy Adams, both Presidents of
the United States. Upon the opposite wall are placed
portraits of Presidents Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and
Jackson.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>A small staircase leads to the private apartments of
La Fayette. Near the entrance door is placed a portrait
of the corporal of the prison of Olmütz, made from a
sketch drawn by La Fayette’s daughter Anastasie during
their imprisonment. She is said to have made the
sketch upon her thumb-nail to avoid the notice of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>jailers. The hangings in La Fayette’s bed-chamber are
of yellow silk, the furniture is simple, and the walls of
the room are covered with family portraits and engravings.
On one side of the chimney hangs a large miniature
of Mr. F. K. Huger, the son of Major Huger of
South Carolina, who may be called La Fayette’s deliverer,
on account of his bold attempt to secure his release
from the prison of Olmütz. The portrait is surrounded
with a gold frame of exquisite workmanship and inclosed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>in a box of massive gold. It was presented to La Fayette
in 1825 by the city of Charleston. Above the bed
is a painting representing a group of American officers,
together with La Fayette
and General Rochambeau,
at the siege
of Yorktown. Upon
a chest of drawers is
placed a silver vase
presented to La Fayette
by the midshipmen
of the <em>Brandywine</em>
frigate. Among
numerous decorations
on the vase, consisting
of vine leaves,
river gods, and acanthus
leaves, the American
eagle is carved
on one side grasping
in one of his talons a
bundle of javelins,
and in the other an
olive-branch: above
him floats a cloud
spangled with stars.
Upon the base of the
vase are three bas-reliefs
representing
the Capitol at Washington,
La Fayette’s visit to the tomb of Washington,
and the arrival of the <em>Brandywine</em> at Havre.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the vase is a box containing the silver epaulettes,
embroidered with three stars, which La Fayette wore as
Commander-in-chief of the National Guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beside the chimney stands the cane usually carried by
La Fayette. It was the gift of Commodore Taylor. The
head is a stag’s horn, with a gold plate upon the side,
with the name of the giver and receiver. In the presses
of the bed-chamber are preserved the general’s clothes.
Amongst them is a complete uniform of the Warsaw
National Guard, presented by the Poles; also a blue
cloth suit, given to him by the Americans of Carolina.
The cloth of the coat and the massive gold buttons are
of Carolina manufacture. On the buttons is the head of
Washington.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s library contains numerous paintings, in
the cameo style, representing Washington, Franklin, and
many others. There are many fine works of German
and English history, and various other valuable books.
A special place is reserved for American works. The
most remarkable among these is a superb manuscript
folio, presented to La Fayette by the city of New York.
It contains the acts and deliberations of that city, together
with a narrative of the events which relate to La Fayette’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>visit there. It is adorned with artistic pen drawings.
The volume is richly bound, and to preserve it
from injury is inclosed in a mahogany box with lock and
key.</p>

<div  class='figleft id030'>
<img src='images/i-522c.jpg' alt='Seal' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The furniture of this room is of mahogany,
with the exception of two chairs,
the cushions of which were embroidered
by Madame La Fayette. In
the table drawer are two seals;
one bears La Fayette’s monogram;
the other, the head of
Washington, surrounded by
rays. Among the other mementos in this
room is a Roman standard, presented to
General La Fayette by the city of Lyons.
This trophy is ornamented with a crown
of oak leaves, surmounted by the Gallic
cock, inclosing a large shield, on one side
of which is represented the self-devoted
Curtius, precipitating himself into the
gulf, the flames of which
already envelop his
horse’s breast, and on the
other side of the shield is
a lion, which had been
adopted as the arms of that
city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another interesting relic is a civic
crown of silver, presented to La Fayette
by the town of Grenoble. Near it is a
handsome medal presented by the electors
of Meaux. Upon one side is a striking likeness of La
Fayette, together with the memorable dates, 1789 and
1830. On the other side, a civic crown forms a frame
for the words of dedication.</p>

<img src='images/i-523b.jpg' alt='Ring Given by Grandson of Washington' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>There are a number of quaint souvenirs of General
Washington, which were highly prized by La Fayette.
One is an ivory-handled pair of glasses mounted in silver,
constantly used by Washington; also a long-handled
parasol, with an ivory top, which was generally attached
to the horse’s saddle when Washington travelled. There
is also a piece of tapestry embroidered by Mrs. Washington,
which was presented to La Fayette by her granddaughter.
Here may be seen, too, the ring given to the
marquis at Mount Vernon during his last visit to America,
by the grandson of Mrs. Washington,
in the name of the family.
The chestnut hair in the middle of
the ring is Washington’s; the white
hair on each side, that of his wife.
Around the hair are the words,
“Pater Patriæ“; on the sides, “Mount Vernon”; and
behind, the following inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<img src='images/i-524.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>One of the most interesting among the Washington
souvenirs is the Decoration of the Cincinnati, worn by
Washington. The Society of the Cincinnati, recognizing
the assistance which America
had received from France,
sent the decoration of the
order to the Counts d’Estaing,
de Grasse, de Barras,
de Rochambeau, and to La
Fayette. Washington had
been president of the order.
The decoration, of enamelled
gold, is framed in a laurel
crown, sustained by two cornucopiæ,
interwoven together,
from which issues fruit,
and which are themselves
suspended to the ribbon by
an oblong ring, formed by
two tresses attached together.
The American eagle,
with extended wings, occupies
the middle of the crown,
and bears a shield on each
side. On one of the shields
may be seen Cincinnatus
leaning on his plough, and
receiving the Roman deputies,
who present him with
the sword of the dictator.
Around it are these words, written in letters of gold on
a sky-blue ground: “<span class='sc'>Omnia.</span> <span class='sc'>Relinquit.</span> <span class='sc'>Servare.</span>
<span class='sc'>Rempu.</span>”</p>

<div id='i525a'  class='figleft id033'>
<img src='images/i-525a.jpg' alt='Pin presented by Franklin’s Granddaughter' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>On the other shield Cincinnatus is represented as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>resuming his agricultural labors, and guiding a plough.
At a little distance is his cottage. This scene is illumined
by the sun, and around are the words: “<span class='sc'>Soci. Cin.
Rum. Inst. a.d. 1783. Virt. Prae.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010'>The figures of the shields are of dead gold, the ground
of green, and the background of carnation enamel. The
decoration is attached to a sky-blue watered silk ribbon,
edged with a white piping, in token of the alliance between
France and America, and held together by a gold
clasp. The ribbon used by Washington is much worn.
On the morocco leather box which encloses the decoration,
are the words, “Washington’s Cincinnati Badge.”</p>

<img src='images/i-525b.jpg' alt='Ring containing Hair and Portrait of Jeremy Bentham' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Here may also be seen a cane, formerly
used by Franklin, which was given to La
Fayette on his last visit to America. Also
a pin, presented to La Fayette by Franklin’s
granddaughter. This contains the
hair, and presents Franklin’s
monogram. Near it
is a ring containing the
hair and portrait of the
celebrated English writer,
Jeremy Bentham. In a crystal box, mounted in gold,
and closed with a small padlock, lie two sad mementos
of the unfortunate Riégo, who perished on the scaffold.
Just before the
terrible end he
untied his black
silk cravat and
sent it, with a
lock of his hair,
to his wife.
Madame Riégo afterwards divided these sacred relics
with La Fayette. Through the clear crystal the memorable
souvenirs may be reverently examined.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Another curiosity is a round wooden box. The lid is
divided into four parts formed of different woods. The
walnut wood is from the last tree of the forest of Penn,
cut down in 1818, opposite
to the Hall of Independence.
The elm wood is
from the treaty tree. The
oak is from the first bridge
constructed on the Dock
Creek. The mahogany is
from the house of Christopher Columbus.</p>

<div id='i526'  class='figright id032'>
<img src='images/i-526.jpg' alt='Round Wooden Box' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>There is also another interesting American relic, in the
shape of a cane, upon which is carved a portrait of La
Fayette. During La Fayette’s last visit to America an
old captain sought him out in Nashville, and with tears
in his eyes, embraced him, saying: “I have had two
happy days in my existence—that on which I landed
with you at Charleston, in 1777, and this day. I have
seen and embraced you. I now desire to live no longer.
I have nothing but this cane, on which you see your portrait;
I request you to accept it, and to keep it in memory
of one of your old soldiers and companions in arms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another handsome souvenir is a sword presented to
La Fayette by the New York militia. Also a sword of
ivory and gold, presented to La Fayette by Colonel Muir
in the name of the ninth regiment of artillery of New
York.</p>

<div id='i527'  class='figleft id036'>
<img src='images/i-527.jpg' alt='Sword presented by the 9th Regt. of Artillery of New York.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>But the memento of the greatest importance in the
collection is probably the sword of honor presented to
La Fayette by Congress, and transmitted to him by
Franklin, through his grandson. We have mentioned
this sword previously, but did not describe it. This
weapon is a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>chef d’&oelig;uvre</em></span> of art. During the Reign of
Terror, Madame La Fayette, fearing it would be seized, ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>the sword
to be buried. It
remained concealed
for many
years and was
thus saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>When George
La Fayette returned
from
America, while
his father was
still in exile, he
disinterred this
famous weapon,
but found the
blade had been
completely destroyed
by rust.
George was able
to preserve only
the handle and
the mounting,
which he conveyed
secretly to
his father in
Holland, running
great risks thereby,
as it was very
dangerous to take
gold out of France
in those unsettled
times. On
La Fayette’s return to France, he conceived the happy
idea of adjusting to this handle, the blade of the sword
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>presented to him
by the National
Guard of Paris.
This blade was
manufactured
from the iron
bolts and bars of
the Bastile, and
presents some
allegorical subjects
connected
with the destruction
of that renowned
fortress.</p>

<div id='i528'  class='figleft id037'>
<img src='images/i-528.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>Sword presented by the American Congress.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The sword as
it now appears is
thus described.
“The knob of the
handle presents,
on one side, a
shield with La
Fayette’s arms—a
marquis’s
coronet surmounted
by a
streamer—on
which is inscribed
the motto,
‘<span class='sc'>Cur Non</span>.’
On the other side
is a medallion
representing the
first quarter of the moon, whose rays are shed over the sea,
and the land of the American continent, which is perceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>on the horizon. The coasts of France form the
foreground of the scene, surmounted by a floating band,
on which are read the words: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Crescam ut Prosim</span></span>,’—an
allusion to the rising liberty and the subsequent prosperity
of America. In the centre of the handle, on each
side, are two oblong medallions: the first represents La
Fayette, who has drawn the sword, and overthrown the
English lion at his feet. The general is on the point of
despatching him, but he pauses, extends his hand, and
seems inclined to spare his life. On the other medallion
America is represented as having just broken her fetters.
She is portrayed under the form and features of a young
woman, half-clad, seated under a military tent. In one
hand she holds her broken chains, and with the other
she presents a laurel branch to La <a id='corr446.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Fayettte'>Fayette</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_446.15'><ins class='correction' title='Fayettte'>Fayette</ins></a></span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Above and below the two preceding medallions are
military emblems of arms, and two crowns of laurel
which encircle the handle. On the sides of the guard
are other trophies of arms; and on one of them are the
words: ‘<span class='sc'>From the American Congress to Marquis
La Fayette, 1779.</span>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The curved parts of the guard are carved on both
sides, and represent on their medallions four memorable
events of the American war in which La Fayette was
distinguished by his prudence or his courage. They are
‘<span class='sc'>The Battle of Gloucester in the Jerseys</span>,’ ‘<span class='sc'>The
Retreat of Barren Hill</span>,’ ‘<span class='sc'>The Battle of Monmouth</span>,’
‘<span class='sc'>The Retreat of Rhode Island</span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The blade of the sword is flat and double-edged. On
one side is a medallion damaskeened in gold, and suspended
by chains of the same metal, which stand out
admirably on the azure ground of the steel. It represents
the taking of the Bastile. The populace of Paris,
placed in the foreground of the scene, lay siege to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>fortress, the ramparts of which give way under the
repeated cannonade. The besieged make a vigorous
resistance from the summit of the towers, and Fame flies
through the air, announcing by sound of trumpet the
first year of liberty. Beneath the medallion are two
lighted flambeaux, from the centre of which issue the
supporters of a bell put in motion to sound the tocsin.
These flambeaux are joined by a crosspiece supporting a
drapery, on which may be read, ‘<span class='sc'>The Revival of
Liberty</span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the other side of the blade may be observed four
medallions, also supported by chains tastefully arranged.
In two of these medallions the polished steel of the
blade is bare; in a third is seen a prisoner breaking the
fetters which had been attached to his hands and feet,
and quitting the stake to which he had been bound; the
fourth represents the column of liberty erected on the
ruins of the Bastile, and rising above the other buildings,
which are perceived on the sides. Beneath the latter
medallion is represented the head of Medusa, and on
each side are two fires, the flames of which melt the
chains interwoven together, and supporting and uniting
these different objects. On the drapery, at the bottom,
are engraved the words, ‘<span class='sc'>Year IV. of Liberty</span>.’</p>

<div id='i532'  class='figright id038'>
<img src='images/i-532.jpg' alt='Vase presented by the National Guard' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The mounting of the scabbard is of gold, and carved.
On one side is perceived a large oval medallion, which
represents Fame borne on the clouds. The goddess
crosses the ocean, preceding the vessel which conveys
La Fayette back to France, and which is perceived in the
horizon. In one hand she holds the crown awarded to La
Fayette by America, and in the other, the trumpet with
which she announces his exploits to France, as indicated
by the three <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fleurs-de-lis</em></span> embroidered on the banner of
the instrument. On the other side is an irregular shield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>encircled with a laurel branch, intended to receive La
Fayette’s monogram.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must not overlook one most impressive object
in the general’s library. This is the magnificent monumental
vase presented by the National Guard of France
to La Fayette. It was commenced in 1831, but owing to
some delay, it was not finished until 1835, at which time
the illustrious La Fayette had passed beyond all earthly
honors and human homage. It was accordingly presented
in the name of the National Guard of France to
George Washington La Fayette, who received the precious
deposit in memory of his adored father, as a holy
memento and noble inheritance, and reverently placed
it in the general’s library, by the side of the other sacred
relics consecrated to his memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The vase, which is of silver gilt, and the stand, in
the form of a votive altar and of the same metal, is about
four feet high. The handles are formed of two strong
vine-stalks, attached at one end to the edges of the neck,
and supported at the other by two lions’ heads. The
neck is enriched with a civic crown, and the bottom of
the vase is ornamented with leaves of aquatic plants,
separated by stems of the sugar-cane and coffee-tree.
On one of the sides of the vase, the genius of the fine
arts and the genius of industry, surrounded with their
attributes, support a drapery, on which may be read,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘<span class='sc'>France</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>To General La Fayette</span>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“On the other side, surrounded with a glory, is the
date 1830. The pedestal is square, with splayed-off corners,
and is decorated with four statues and four bas-reliefs,
which may be regarded as so many masterpieces
of taste and historical illustration. The statues, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>represent Liberty,
Equality, Force, and
Wisdom, are placed
upright on a projecting
ledge prepared
to receive them.
Liberty is represented
under the form
of a young woman in
full drapery, and
with a Phrygian cap
on her head. In
one hand she holds
the national flag,
and in the other, the
sword to defend it,
whilst she tramples
under foot a set of
broken chains.
Equality is represented
by a goddess
holding in her right
hand the levelling-plane,
while she
leans with her left
upon a table of laws,
thus presenting the
symbol of constitutional
equality.
Force is represented
by a female in the
prime of life. Her head is covered, and she is partly
clothed with a lion’s skin, which falls on her back and her
left shoulder. She leans on a bundle of rods, to indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>that her strength depends on union. Wisdom is represented
under the form of a young female of severe aspect;
her drapery is tasteful, and her head is covered with the
helmet of Minerva. Her calm and grave attitude indicates
reflection.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The four sides of the altar are ornamented with as
many bas-reliefs, well chosen, and representing the following
events connected with the life of La Fayette.
The first bas-relief represents the capitulation of Lord
Cornwallis. La Fayette, with the generals and the respective
staffs of the French and American army, receives
General O’Hara, as he delivers the sword of Cornwallis
to Washington. The second bas-relief represents La
Fayette taking the civic oath to the French Federation,
July 14, 1790.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The third bas-relief represents the visit of the Duke of
Orleans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom, to the Hôtel
de Ville, July 31, 1830.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fourth bas-relief represents the distribution of
the standards to the National Guard at Paris, Aug. 29,
1830.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The room which now serves for the museum was formerly
the entrance to the apartment of Madame La Fayette.
After her death, La Fayette ordered the door of
communication to be walled up, so that the room could
only be entered by himself through a back door. On
stated days the marquis repaired thither, either alone or
with his children, to pay sad homage to the memory of
her who was enshrined in their hearts with an undying
affection.</p>

<p class='c010'>The museum is filled with numerous objects, such as
models of machines, etc., many stuffed birds and reptiles,
shells and minerals, together with a quantity of weapons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>of all kinds, and numberless Indian curiosities collected
by La Fayette during his several visits to America.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inmates of La Grange were illustrious for their
many deeds of benevolence. Their poorer neighbors were
constantly aided by the general and his children. In
times of special sickness among the poor, large sums were
expended by La Fayette and his family in their behalf.
Many charming fêtes were held at the Château, and La
Fayette was always the centre of a brilliant circle. The
venerable marquis was a model host. His guests enjoyed
freedom without restraint, and the most delightful entertainment
without officiousness. His children and grandchildren
seem to have inherited many of his fine traits of
mind and character; and there are few instances given
in history of such a perfect home-life as was witnessed
at La Grange, especially before the removal of her who
was the centre of all its sunshine and the guiding star of
her illustrious husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>The character of La Fayette was singularly lofty, and
he was strongly attracted towards all that was good,
great, noble, or generous in human nature. His moral
and intellectual faculties were keen, his reason was solid,
and his judgment was sure. He was not led into impracticable
theories by too ardent an imagination, and his
enthusiasms were always based upon his conscience and
his reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>His views of morality and politics were very comprehensive,
but his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>beau ideal</em></span> of life was always held within
the bounds of possibility, and governed by the claims of
usefulness, justice, and honor. He was great even in
small circumstances, for he lifted the little to a place of
importance by the exact attention he bestowed upon it.
He judged mankind by his own exalted nature, and his
illusions regarding them arose from the impossibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>such an upright mind as he possessed being capable of
perceiving or believing that others were so far beneath
the high motives which governed his own thoughts and
actions. “His conscience was his guiding star, his courage
the pilot that led him safe through the storm by
which France was overwhelmed, and his progress through
that grand epoch was marked by patriotism, civic courage,
and a series of advantageous reforms and liberal
institutions, with which he assisted to ameliorate the
condition of France.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette passed untainted through an age of corruption,
and was proof against the seductive excesses of the
court of Louis XV., and retained his moral integrity in
the midst of the temptations and the terrible whirlwinds
of political storms which raged with relentless fury during
the reign of the unfortunate Louis XVI. To his early
avowed principles of liberty and patriotism he was ever
true as the needle to the magnet. No emoluments could
bribe him to advocate a wrong principle; no terrors could
deter him from stanchly and fearlessly upholding what
his conscience acknowledged to be the cause of truth and
liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette loved truth above all things, and rejected
all that could change or corrupt its nature. Like Epaminondas,
he would not have suffered himself, even in joke,
to utter the slightest falsehood. He was the mirror of
truth, even in the midst of political parties, whose condemnation
he pronounced by presenting to them the hideous
image of their passions. He thus offended without
convincing them, and the mirror, being declared deceitful,
was destined to be broken.” He was heard to say: “The
court would have accepted me had I been an aristocrat,
and the Jacobins, had I been a Jacobin; but, as I wished
to side with neither, both united against me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>The following incident is related, illustrative of La
Fayette’s generosity:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the occasion of his last visit to America, General
La Fayette having learned that the family of his old
aide-de-camp, Colonel Neville, was in difficulties, before he
embarked for France drew a bill of exchange in their
favor, on the President of the United States, for the sum
of four thousand dollars, and addressed it to the children
of M. Neville. It may be easily conceived that the latter
declined making use of it; but they keep it as a
precious document which reflects equal honor on the
memory of their father and on the noble generosity of
La Fayette.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s ambition was not a selfish desire to rise
above others, to achieve personal fame; but to do good,
by the performance of noble actions and important services
in behalf of humanity. He thus defines his own
impulses in a letter to the Bailli de Ploën: “An irresistible
passion that would induce me to believe in innate
ideas and the truth of prophecy, has decided my career.
I have always loved liberty with the enthusiasm which
actuates the religious man, with the passion of a lover,
and with the conviction of a geometrician. On leaving
college, where nothing had displeased me more than a
state of dependence, I viewed the greatness and the
littleness of the court with contempt, the frivolities of
society with pity, the minute pedantry of the army with
disgust, and oppression of every sort with indignation.
The attraction of the American Revolution drew me suddenly
to my proper place; I felt myself tranquil only
when sailing between the continent whose powers I had
braved, and the place where, although our arrival and
our ultimate success were problematical, I could, at the
age of nineteen, take refuge in the alternative of conquering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>or perishing in the cause to which I had devoted
myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette valued reputation and prized glory, but
was indifferent to the personal power resulting from
them. Being asked who, in his opinion, was the greatest
man of his age, he replied: “In my idea, General
Washington is the greatest man; for I look upon him
as the most virtuous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Cloquet says of La Fayette’s equitable disposition:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I doubt if La Fayette was ever in a passion; at least
I have no recollection of having seen him lose his temper,
even under circumstances that might have occasioned or
excused one of those violent movements of the soul
which few men are able to master. When any circumstance
annoyed him, he became taciturn, his forehead
and eyebrows slightly contracted, and a shade of sadness
was visible on his countenance; but these moments of
uneasiness rather than of ill humor were not of long
duration, and his features soon recovered their serenity.
One day one of his friends had uttered, from the tribune
of the Lower Chamber, certain opinions which he repelled
as utterly at variance with his principles. The only
phrase in which he expressed his dissatisfaction was,
‘Well, well, he lacks common sense.’ These words he
pronounced in a firm tone of voice, though evidently
with much emotion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That which was right was always the rule of La Fayette’s
conduct; the inspirations of his heart and the voice
of his conscience regulated his life. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Fais ce que dois,
advienne que pourra</em></span>” was his motto. His moral faculties
exercised complete control over his physical powers;
it was said of him, “He was an intelligence served by
organs.” His calmness was only increased by an increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>of danger, and the most imminent peril seemed
but to inspire him with redoubled courage.</p>

<p class='c010'>His surgeon, M. Cloquet, gives this instance of his
marvellous powers of physical endurance:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“During his last illness he acquainted us with the
nature of the medical treatment which he had undergone
in 1803 for a fracture of the thigh, occasioned by a fall
on a slippery pavement. Deschamp and Boyer, whose
memory I respect, and whom I am proud to have had for
my masters, were summoned in their professional capacity
to his assistance. The fractured limb was inclosed
in a machine which kept it in a constant state of tension;
and, as La Fayette had promised those skilful surgeons
to support the pain with patience as long as they might
judge it necessary for his cure, he uttered not a single
complaint for the fifteen or twenty days during which
the apparatus was applied. When it was removed, the
surgeons were unable to conceal the annoyance they felt
at the effect produced by the bandages. Deschamp
turned pale; Boyer was stupefied; the upper bandages
had, by their pressure, cut deeply into the muscles of
the inside of the thigh, and laid bare the femoral artery:
the action of the lower ones had been less violent, but
they had produced a mortification of the skin at the
back part of the foot and laid bare the tendons of the
toes. In consequence of La Fayette’s stoical fortitude,
the vigilance of his surgeons was completely at fault.
Deep scars bore evidence of the truth of one of his
observations to us, uttered, however, in confidence,
through an apprehension of injuring, not the interests,
but the memory of two individuals for whom he felt
gratitude, although their exertions on his behalf had
been unsuccessful. A length of time elapsed before he
recovered from the lamentable consequences which resulted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>from his medical treatment, and which were followed
by an almost complete anchylosis and lameness of
the hip-joint.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s frankness of nature was proverbial. An
intimate friend of the family, Madame Dupaty, said of
him:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“To appreciate his frankness you must have known
him as thoroughly as we did. He was too honest not to
leave his keys always in the locks, even in politics.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s conversation was graceful, easy, full of
good humor, and peculiarly charming, without descending
to frivolity. He was quick at repartee, and apt in
uttering <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bon mots</em></span>, as the following incidents will illustrate:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When he was arrested by the Austrians in 1792, an
aide-de-camp of Prince de ——, the enemy’s general, came
to him, on behalf of his superior, to demand the money
of the army which he had been obliged to leave. La
Fayette, astonished at the demand, laughed heartily;
and when the aide-de-camp advised him to take the matter
more seriously, ‘How can I help laughing?’ said he;
‘for all that I can understand of your demand is, that
had your prince been in my place he would have run
away with the military chest.’ The aide-de-camp had
nothing to say in reply, took leave of the prisoner, and
departed as he came.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When he joined the nobles of Brittany, in 1788, in
their movement against the government, the queen impatiently
asked him why he, who was from Auvergne,
meddled with the affairs of the Bretons. “I am a
Breton, Madam,” replied La Fayette, “just as your
Majesty is of the house of Hapsburg.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As La Fayette’s mother was from Brittany, so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>queen was descended from the house of Hapsburg by
the female line.</p>

<p class='c010'>None of the speeches pronounced by La Fayette in
the Chamber of Deputies were prepared. His extempore
addresses were eloquent, dignified, and clear. His language
was persuasive and pleasing, and his speeches
were intelligible to all classes, on account of their simplicity
and the directness of their appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>A friend of La Fayette one day overheard the conversation
of several French artisans, who were discussing
in the street the merits of the articles in a newspaper
they were reading, and after criticising with warmth
many of the writers, the leader exclaimed, “Come, this
man La Fayette at least speaks French: we can understand
what he wishes to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The English language was as familiar to La Fayette
as the French, and he wrote both with great facility.
His style was simple, concise, and clear-cut, forceful and
elevated; his ideas were well defined, his principles and
opinions decided and frankly avowed. Regarding the
English correspondence of La Fayette with his friend
Masclet, an Englishman thus comments:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Fayette has happily avoided the two principal
dangers to which the majority of those who attempt to
write in a foreign language are exposed. His style is as
free from servile imitation as from grammatical errors or
faults of idiom: in a word, it is peculiar to himself;
it displays the man, though under another costume. It
is simple without meanness, concise without obscurity,
dignified without affectation; and often contains those
happy turns of expression which infuse such a charm
into letters written in French. Scarcely ever does it
contain one of those little particles which betray the
foreign origin of the writer. His letters, it is true, present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>some inversions not authorized perhaps by modern
custom, but by no means at variance with the genius of
the language. On the contrary, they establish a sort of
link between the writer and the old English authors.
Such inversions are admirable for their delicacy and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>naïveté</em></span>; without shocking the ear, or proving injurious
to clearness of expression, they arrest the attention of
the reader, deck themselves, as it were, in the smile
resulting from his agreeable surprise, and prevent monotony
of style. La Fayette writes English with much
facility. His letters present no trace of painful effort
or labored composition. He seems never to hesitate in
his choice of a suitable word or turn of expression,
though he sometimes forgets that the English language
can with difficulty bend to that nervous and even elliptic
concision of which a skilful French writer often avails
himself with so much advantage. This forgetfulness
occasionally gives an appearance of roughness and even
abruptness to La Fayette’s style.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His letters are irreproachable, as presenting a faithful
picture of his mind; in reading them we feel irresistibly
inclined to love the writer; and perhaps in this
respect they are inferior to nothing ever composed by
him in his own language. Amongst the English, and
others who speak that language, such expressions as are
employed to depict different degrees of friendship are
certainly less numerous and less graceful than amongst
the French; but, on the other hand, such expressions
have been less frequently subject to the encroachments
of gallantry or exaggerated politeness, and are consequently
more candid and sincere. In the mouth of such
a man as La Fayette, it will be readily imagined that all
these qualities acquire new force.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s handwriting was more legible in English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>than in French. His characters were small and well
formed. Though he never made rough copies, his letters
rarely presented erasures. A writer says of the value of
his letters:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is almost superfluous to say how La Fayette’s letters
were received by those to whom they were addressed.
It was enough to present them to meet with unlimited
support, protection, and devotedness. The name of the
writer was a species of talisman which opened every
door; and it might have been said that to such as received
his letters, a spark was communicated from his
soul, and a desire to imitate his virtues. Some years
ago one of my friends, who was abroad, showed a letter
from La Fayette to a distinguished personage entrusted
with the confidence of an absolute sovereign. At sight
of the letter, the powerful functionary seemed electrified,
rose from his seat in token of respect, and entreated my
friend as a special favor to give him a fragment of the
precious correspondence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette always gave precedence to his duty rather
than his personal interests. To the Bailli de Ploën he
wrote: “So many stupid remarks have been uttered by
party spirit, that it may not be out of place here to assert
that no private affection has ever diverted me from
my public duty. In the course of three years of power
I encouraged none to speak well of me; I prevented
none from speaking ill; and to explain my conduct with
regard to the notorious characters of the Revolution, it
will be sufficient to verify their writings, speeches, and
actions at the same period.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding his own ideas of liberty and equality, he
wrote to the same friend: “For my part, as I feel persuaded
that the human race was created to enjoy freedom,
and as I have been born to promote the cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>liberty, I neither can nor will shrink from the participation
which it has been my fate to take in this great
event; wherever I have been able, and especially in my
own country, I concurred on principle in all the enterprises
undertaken against an illegitimate power which it
was necessary to destroy, and I now declare to you that
in 1787 and 1788 the resistance of the privileged classes—of
the leaders of the aristocracy—had as much of
the true character of faction as any other insurrection
that I have since witnessed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette could never be persuaded to use violent
measures in upholding even a good cause when such an
expedient was not absolutely necessary. At one time
during the Revolution, Mirabeau having recommended
some very violent plans to La Fayette, urging that they
were excusable for the execution of certain projects, La
Fayette indignantly exclaimed, “M. de Mirabeau, it is
impossible for an honest man to employ such means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An honest man!” replied Mirabeau. “Ah! M. de
La Fayette, it seems you wish to be a <em>Grandison Cromwell</em>:
you will see to what that amalgamation will lead
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wherever the voice of duty called La Fayette, no
danger could make him flinch, no fear of insult could
deter. During the days of October, 1789, when the palace
of Versailles was filled with the raging, bloodthirsty
mob, La Fayette hastened to an apartment where the
crowd was the thickest, and calmly entered, and crossed
the <em>Salon</em> without attendants. “There goes Cromwell!”
cried one. Turning to the speaker, La Fayette replied
with dignity, “Cromwell would not have entered here
<span class='fss'>ALONE</span>!” Notwithstanding the difference of opinion
between La Fayette and Napoleon, whenever it appeared
to La Fayette that his services could be of use to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>best interests of his country, he was ever ready to sacrifice
all personal feeling. Before the battle of Marengo,
La Fayette addressed a letter to a friend, instructing him
to deliver the communication to Napoleon, in case the
battle of Marengo should be lost. In this letter La
Fayette offered his services to Bonaparte, in defence of
the independence of France. As the battle was won, the
epistle was not delivered; but Napoleon was informed of
the step which La Fayette contemplated taking in case
of defeat. One day, while surrounded by his staff of
officers, Bonaparte expressed his admiration of the patriotism
of the man with whom he differed in opinion, and
added, “Which of you, gentlemen, could have done
better?”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette always recollected with pride and with
pleasure the services rendered to France by the National
Guard, and he thus wrote of them:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Revolution had armed France; it was urgent to
bestow on her an organization, and to that end the observations
which I had made in America and in several
parts of Europe were directed. The National Guard
was instituted; this was the sole armed force which
could maintain internal order without favoring military
despotism, and by means of which foreign aggression
could be repelled, whilst the ancient governments were
reduced to the inability of defending themselves against
us, unless they imitated us; or against their subjects, if
they ventured to follow our example.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was a warm advocate in favor of educating
the masses; he often said, “that a good education, physical,
moral, and intellectual, was in his opinion the best
inheritance that parents could transmit to their children;
and he considered it to be their duty to make every sacrifice
to insure to their offspring this imperishable advantage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>which could not but in time prove conducive to
their happiness and that of others.” He expressed to
his physician his astonishment that in colleges young
people were forced to study the course of different rivers
in India or Mexico, whilst no pains were taken to impart
to them a knowledge of themselves, by giving them some
notions of their own organizations and the exercise of
their functions. He was desirous that great pains should
be taken with the moral and political education of the
people, thus insuring their being well-informed and good
citizens. He contended that education was calculated to
purify the manners of a nation, and contribute to its
happiness. And in proof of his own opinions, La Fayette
himself might well have been cited as a type of a
perfectly civilized being, whom civilization has improved
instead of deteriorating; for he had avoided all its vices,
and followed only with undeviating step the path traced
by virtue and true liberty. He declared that every
member of a well-constituted society should receive an
education that might point out to him the path which he
ought to pursue between his duties and his rights; and
that such an education would prove much more effectual
for the prevention than the law was for the repression of
disorder.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette considered that labor was the first duty of
man living in a social state, as it was only by labor that
one’s debt to society could be repaid. He countenanced
amusements when they were pure and healthful, and
considered them a necessary relaxation from bodily or
mental occupations.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette recognized liberty of conscience and was
tolerant of all religious beliefs. “If it be a crime,” he
declared, “to have preferred civil and religious liberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>extended equally to all men and all countries, none is
more guilty than myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When La Fayette had been proscribed in 1792, the National
Convention confiscated all his property, and ordered
his negroes at Cayenne to be sold, in spite of the
remonstrances of La Fayette, who declared that the negroes
had been purchased only to receive their liberty
after they had been prepared to exercise it by proper
education, and not to be again sold as slaves. At a later
period all the negroes of the French colonies were declared
free by a decree of the National Convention. It
is interesting to note in connection with this effort of La
Fayette to bring about the abolition of slavery, that during
his last visit to America he visited a free school of
young Africans in New York, which had been founded
and instituted by the society for the emancipation of the
negroes. This incident is related of his visit to this
school. A young negro approached La Fayette and
said to him, with much emotion: “You see, General,
these hundreds of poor African children who appear before
you; here they share the benefits of education with
the children of the whites: like them, they learn to
cherish the recollection of the services which you have
rendered to America, and they also revere in you an ardent
friend to the emancipation of their race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette was very desirous of instituting prison
reforms in France, but he was no advocate for the complete
seclusion of prisoners. “Solitary confinement,”
said he, “is a punishment which to be judged of must
have been endured.” Surely he spoke from a bitter experience,
for he had suffered its terrible tortures for one
year. Capital punishment was held in horror by La
Fayette, and he constantly raised his voice against such
penalty, especially in matters of political misdemeanors.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>And no wonder that he shrank in loathing abhorrence
from the bloody guillotine, after his experience of the
awful Reign of Terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Cloquet says in his recollections of La Fayette,
regarding his opinions on different subjects:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was familiar with all questions of morals, jurisprudence,
policy, and public economy, and he could have
treated them all <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ex professo</em></span>. I have frequently heard
him speak of the resources of France and other states;
of the relations which people and governments should
have to each other; of constitutions, legitimacy, property;
of commerce, industry, agriculture; of the art of
war, the progress of civilization, the happiness of nations
and individuals; and other questions which he treated in
the most lucid manner, and which he solved with his
natural good sense and simplicity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Encyclopædia Britannica thus sums up the characteristics
of La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“His life was beset with inconceivable responsibility
and perils, for he was ever the minister of humanity and
order among a frenzied people who had come to regard
order and humanity as phases of treason. He rescued
the queen from the murderous hands of the populace,
not to speak of multitudes of humbler victims who had
been devoted to death. He risked his life in many unsuccessful
attempts to rescue others. He was obliged
to witness the butchery of Foulon, and the reeking
heart of Berthier torn from his lifeless body and held
up in triumph before him. Disgusted with enormities
which he was powerless to prevent and could not countenance,
he resigned his commission; but so impossible
was it to replace him that he was induced to resume
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the Constituent Assembly, of which he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>member, his influence was always felt in favor of republican
principles, for the abolition of arbitrary imprisonment,
for religious tolerance, for popular representation,
for the establishment of trial by jury, for the gradual
emancipation of slaves, for the freedom of the press, for
the abolition of titles of nobility, and the suppression of
privileged orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Few men have owed more of their success and usefulness
in the world to their family rank than La Fayette,
and still fewer have abused it less. He never
achieved distinction in the field, and his political career
proved him to be incapable of ruling a great national
movement; but he had strong convictions which always
impelled him to study the interests of humanity, and
a pertinacity in maintaining them, which, in all the
marvellous vicissitudes of his singularly eventful life,
secured him a very unusual measure of public respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No citizen of a foreign country has ever had so many
and such warm admirers in America, nor does any statesman
in France appear to have ever possessed uninterruptedly
for so many years so large a measure of popular
influence and respect. He had what Jefferson called
a ‘canine appetite’ for popularity and fame, but in him
the appetite only seemed to make him more anxious to
merit the fame which he enjoyed. He was brave even
to rashness; his life was one of constant personal peril,
and yet he never shrank from any danger or responsibility
if he saw the way open to spare life or suffering, to
protect the defenceless, to sustain the law and preserve
order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hon. Chauncey Depew thus concisely comments upon
La Fayette’s influence in France:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“While the principles of the American Devolution
were fermenting in France, La Fayette, the hero and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>favorite of the hour, was an honored guest at royal
tables and royal camps. The proud Spaniard and the
Great Frederick of Germany alike welcomed him, and
everywhere he announced his faith in government
founded on the American idea. The financial crisis
in the affairs of King Louis on the one hand, and the
rising tide of the popular passion on the other, compelled
the summons of the Assembly of Notables at Versailles.
All the great officers of state, the aristocracy,
the titled clergy, the royal princes, were there, but no
representative of the people. La Fayette spoke for
them, and, fearless of the efforts of the brother of the
king to put him down, he demanded religious toleration,
equal taxes, just and equal administration of the laws,
and the reduction of royal expenditures to fixed and
reasonable limits. This overturned the whole feudal
fabric which had been in course of construction for a
thousand years. To make effectual and permanent this
tremendous stride toward the American experiment, he
paralyzed the court and cabinet by the call for a national
assembly—an assembly of the people. Through
that assembly he carried a declaration of rights, founded
upon the natural liberties of man, a concession of popular
privilege never before secured in the modern history
of Europe; and, going as far as he believed the times
would admit toward his idea of an American republic,
he builded upon the ruins of absolutism a constitutional
monarchy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But French democracy had not been trained and educated
in the schools of the Puritan or the colonist. Ages
of tyranny, of suppression, repression, and torture had
developed the tiger and dwarfed the man. Democracy
had not learned the first rudiments of liberty,—self-restraint
and self-government. It beheaded king and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>queen; it drenched the land with the blood of the noblest
and best; in its indiscriminate frenzy and madness it
spared neither age nor sex, virtue nor merit, and drove
its benefactor, because he denounced its excesses and
tried to stem them, into exile and the dungeon of Olmütz.
Thus ended in the horrors of the French Revolution
La Fayette’s first fight for liberty at home. After
five years of untold sufferings, spurning release at the
price of his allegiance to monarchy, holding with sublime
faith, amidst the most disheartening and discouraging
surroundings, to the principles of freedom for all, he was
released by the sword of Napoleon Bonaparte, to find
that the untamed ferocity of the Revolution had been
trained to the service of the most brilliant, captivating,
and resistless of military despotisms by the mighty genius
of the great Dictator. He only was neither dazzled
nor dismayed, and when he had rejected every offer of
recognition and honor, Napoleon said: ‘La Fayette
alone in France holds fast to his original ideas of liberty.
Though tranquil now, he will reappear if occasion
offers.’ Against the first consulate of Bonaparte he
voted, ‘No, unless with guaranties of freedom.’ When
Europe lay helpless at the feet of the conqueror, and, in
the frenzy of military glory, France neither saw nor felt
the chains he was forging upon her, La Fayette, from his
retirement of La Grange, plead with the Emperor for
republican principles, holding up to him the retributions
always meted out to tyrants, and the pure, undying fame
of the immortal few who patriotically decide, when upon
them alone rests the awful verdict, whether they shall be
the enslavers or the saviors of their country.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sun of Austerlitz set in blood at Waterloo. The
swords of allied kings placed the Bourbon once more on
the throne of France. In the popular tempest of July,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>the nation rose against the intolerable tyranny of the
king, and, calling upon this unfaltering friend of liberty,
said with one voice: ‘You alone can save France from
despotism on the one hand, and the orgies of the Jacobin
mob on the other; take absolute power; be marshal, general,
dictator if you will.’ But in assuming command of
the National Guard, the old soldier and patriot answered,
amidst the hail of shot and shell, ‘Liberty shall triumph,
or we all perish together.’ He dethroned and drove out
Charles X., and France, contented with any destiny he
might accord to her, with unquestioning faith left her
future in his hands. He knew that the French people
were not yet ready to take and faithfully keep American
liberty. He believed that in the school of constitutional
government they would rapidly learn, and, in the fulness
of time adopt its principles, and he gave them a king
who was the popular choice, and surrounded him with
the restraints of charter and an assembly of the people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>M. Francis Hervé, editor of Madame Tussaud’s “Memoirs
of the French Revolution,” gives the following
account of an interview with La Fayette:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“During an interesting conversation which took place
at the apartments of the editor at Paris, a few months
prior to the death of La Fayette, respecting the different
forms of government, he observed that the approaches of
liberty ought always to be very gradual, and not conferred
at once upon those who had lived in a state of
slavery under an arbitrary power, and without the benefit
of education; which opinion was founded upon the
long experience of a life which had been ever devoted to
that subject. Although bent with age, the same philanthropy
and energetic love of freedom glowed within
him as that which characterized his youth, but tempered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>with maturer judgment; hence, when the Revolution of
the three days took place, and he was called upon as the
arbiter of France respecting her government, he decided
for monarchy, with liberal institutions; but observed
that, although a pledge was given for the promotion of
the latter, yet it had never been redeemed; and he sighed
as he made that declaration.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette passed his winters in Paris, and at all seasons
of the year, when he was a member of the Chamber
of Deputies, he resided in the city during the sessions.
He there occupied a suite of apartments in a large hotel
No. 6 Rue d’Anjou, St. Honoré.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Fayette’s occupations in Paris were extremely numerous.
Besides his duties as a deputy, which he performed
with scrupulous exactness, he was obliged to
attend public meetings, committees, relief societies, boards
of instruction, and constant social engagements. Notwithstanding
his multifarious avocations he found time
to devote to his domestic affairs and to his personal
study. He was fond of society, and was a delightful
and brilliant conversationalist.</p>

<p class='c010'>A political duel which terminated in the death of M.
Dulong, one of La Fayette’s fellow-deputies, was a severe
blow to the marquis. Notwithstanding his age, La
Fayette followed the body of his friend to the grave on
foot, and when he returned home he was soon taken
violently ill. Measures were taken which gave him
partial relief, but he never entirely rallied from this
attack. His health became so much improved, however,
that he was allowed to receive the visits of his friends,
who showed their sympathy and regard by the most constant
attentions.</p>

<p>La Fayette’s Death Chamber.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But having been exposed to a severe thunder-storm,
La Fayette returned home wet and exhausted, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>obliged again to take to his bed. His symptoms from time
to time became more alarming, but in every interval of
comparative freedom from the severity of his sufferings
he was cheerful and hopeful. One morning, upon the
arrival of his physician, La Fayette greeted him with a
smile, and exclaimed: “The <cite>Swiss Gazette</cite> has just
killed me, and yet you knew nothing of the matter!
Nay, more: that I might die in due form, the celebrated
Doctor ——, whom I hardly know, has been consulted.”
He then handed the paper to the surgeon, saying,
“After that, believe the public journals if you
can.” The family of La Fayette were desirous of having
a consultation of physicians about his case; but upon
consulting him, he said: “To what purpose? Have I
not entire confidence in you, and can any addition be
made to the care which you take of me, and to the interest
which you feel in my welfare?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>One of his physicians replied: “We think we have
done what is best in your case; but were there only a
single remedy that might escape us, it is our duty to
seek it. We wish to restore you as soon as possible to
health, for we are responsible for your situation towards
your family, your friends, and the French nation, of
whom you are the father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, their father,” answered La Fayette, with a
meaning smile, “on condition that they never follow a
syllable of my advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But his days upon earth were numbered. The valiant
Knight of Liberty must forever sheathe his brave sword,
and the clarion tones of his faithful voice would never
again be heard in defence of the rights of his fellow-men.
His last years were passed in peace crowned with
the undying lustre of well-merited fame, and his self-sacrificing
devotion in the cause of truth and liberty received
its just remuneration in the adoring love of the
people of two continents, united by his patriotic zeal in a
brotherhood sworn to defend the glorious rights of freedom
and humanity. Few men have been so universally
idolized and so universally respected. His glory did
not blaze with the dazzling brilliancy of Napoleon’s fame,
nor can it be said to have equalled that of Washington;
but in some respects his career is unparalleled in history;
and as the champion of human liberty, irrespective of
any clime and any color, unbiassed by any influence of
rank, or wealth, or power; true as the magnet to the
pole, in his stanch adherence to his avowed principles,
La Fayette stands alone in the annals of the world as
the chivalrous Knight of Liberty, wearing the colors of
the goddess of freedom and waving his sword in dauntless
defiance against the despotisms of the nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 20th of May, 1834, as the first blush of dawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>was seen in the east, and the black curtains of the night
were lifted, and the promise of a new day glowed in the
distant horizon; as the birds chanted their morning
matins of praise, and the earth, thrilled by the touch of
nature, awoke to renewed beauty,—the vail which shrouds
the unknown beyond was parted by unseen fingers, and
the soul of La Fayette was wafted by ministering spirits
into the presence of the Almighty Monarch of heaven
and earth, whose Word had gone forth to all the world,
“Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the quiet Picpus Cemetery, in France, in a small
enclosure, the green grass is growing over the headless
trunks of more than one thousand illustrious victims
guillotined at the Barrière du Trône, during the Reign of
Terror, and thrown together in this common grave, called
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Cimetière des Guillotinés</em></span>. Near by this memorable
spot is La Fayette’s tomb, and by his side sleeps his
heroic wife. No grand monument rears its stately head
over their remains; nor is it needed. In letters of gold
are inscribed upon the black marble tablet, which marks
the last resting-place of Liberty’s Knight, the appropriate
motto: “<span class='sc'>Requiescat in Pace</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the blackness of the marble is illumined by the
gleaming letters of golden light, pronouncing a benediction
upon the illustrious sleeper beneath, they become
the symbol of the shining example of his self-sacrificing
life, consecrated to the holy endeavor of dispelling the
black shadows of oppression, that Liberty’s luminous
light might flood the world with refulgent splendor.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>La Fayette!</span> <span class='sc'>Liberty!</span> and <span class='sc'>Law!</span> are the three
shining words written upon the page of history by this
heroic life.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
